"WHILE DRIVING ON CITY STREETS AND HIGHWAYS, THE ADAPTIVE CRUISE CONTROL WILL NOT ENGAGE 25% OF THE TIME AND WILL DISENGAGE WITHOUT NOTICE.  ""ADAPTIVE CRUISE CONTROL WILL APPEAR IN DIC.

"WHEN I STEP ON THE GAS AT LOW SPEED, NORMALLY BETWEEN 30-50MPH MY CAR VIBRATES OR SHUDDERS. IT ONLY DOES THIS WHEN I'M TRYING TO MAINTAIN THOSE LOWER SPEEDS, SO THE PEDAL IS JUST BARELY BEING PRESSED DOWN. ONCE I'M ON THE HIGHWAY ABOVE 50MPH I DON'T HAVE ANY ISSUES."
THE POWER STEERING WILL OCCASIONALLY NOT WORK WHEN YOU START THE CAR BUT IF YOU TURN IT OFF AND START IT UP AGAIN IT WILL WORK. I'LL OCCASIONALLY GET A BURNING SMELL THROUGH MY VENTS AND MY STEERING WHEEL WILL PERIODICALLY SHAKE AS WELL.. I RECENTLY BOUT NEW TIRES OVER THE SUMMER AND IT STOPPED HAPPENING SO I THOUGHT NOTHING OF IT BUT AFTER WASHING MY CAR THE OTHER DAY IT STARTED DOING IT AGAIN

I HAVE HAD AN ONGOING PROBLEM WITH THE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM IN MY TRUCK. FIRST TIME IT HAPPENED I WAS LEAVING MY HOUSE AND AS SOON AS I GOT A FEW HOUSES DOWN THE ROAD MY DOOR LOCKS STARTED UNLOCKING AND LOCKING THEMSELVES OVER AND OVER AND THE SPEEDOMETER GAUGE WAS ALL OVER THE PLACE ALONG WITH THE RPM GAUGE AND THE ROAD UP WOULD TURN OFF AND ON AND THE BRAKES WOULD LOCK UP AND THEN RELEASE AND IT DID THIS UNTIL I WAS ABLE TO PULL OVER AND TURN THE TRUCK OFF. ONCE THE TRUCK WAS OFF IT WOULDN'T START AGAIN. I HAD TAKEN THE BATTERY OUT TO BE TESTED AND IT WAS FINE. THE ALTERNATOR WAS FINE AND AS FAR AS I COULD SEE THE NEGATIVE AND POSITIVE CABLES FROM THE BATTERY WERE CLEAN TOO. I'VE TRACED THE GROUND AND IT DOESN'T APPEAR TO BE IN BAD SHAPE EITHER. WELL AFTER I WAS ABLE TO GET IT BACK TO MY HOUSE IT SAT FOR A FEW DAYS AND AFTER A COUPLE DAYS IT RANDOMLY STARTED BACK UP. TOOK IT TO THE LOCAL CHEVY DEALERSHIP AND THEY SAID THERE IS NO PROBLEM EVERYTHING IS GOOD AND THEY COULDN'T RECREATE THE PROBLEM. THEY SAID IT COULD BE THE AFTERMARKET HEAD UNIT. WELL ONCE I GOT MY TRUCK BACK THE HEAD UNIT NO LONGER WORKS OR GETS POWER? WELL NOW A MONTH LATER SAME PROBLEM AND THE TRUCK IS TOTALLY DEAD BUT BATTERY AND ETC IS FINE.

"DECEMBER 31, 2019 AT 1:18PM, DRIVING AT SPEED ON THE MOST DANGEROUS PORTION OF I-95 IN THE SPRINGFIELD, VA AREA, MERGING FROM A LEFT HIGHWAY ENTRANCE RAMP INTO THE FAR LEFT LANE OF THE HIGHWAY, THE VEHICLE SUDDENLY DROPPED TO 20MPH AND THE WARNING LIGHT CAME ON FOR REDUCED ENGINE POWER. THE VEHICLE WOULD NOT GAIN SPEED, PUTTING MY SON'S AND NUMEROUS OTHER DRIVERS' LIVES IN JEOPARDY. WAS ABLE TO GET TO A DEALER WHO INFORMED US THIS IS A KNOWN PROBLEM AND WILL 'PROBABLY' NOT COST ANYTHING TO REPAIR. THEY TOLD US IT IS SAFE TO DRIVE UNTIL REPAIRS CAN BE MADE IN 3 DAYS, BUT TO BE CAREFUL BECAUSE IT MIGHT HAPPEN AGAIN. THIS IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM AND I BELIEVE THE ADVICE FROM THE DEALER TO CONTINUE DRIVING IT THIS WAY IS RIDICULOUS. THERE SHOULD BE A RECALL IN PLACE FOR THIS PROBLEM BECAUSE THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF REPORTS OF THIS VERY SAME PROBLEM. WE WILL NEVER KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE ALREADY DIED DUE TO THIS PROBLEM AND CHEVROLET AND THE NHTSA FAILING TO DO ITS JOB OF REQUIRING A RECALL."
ENGINE STALLED TWO TIMES ON DIFFERENT OCCASIONS WHILE DRIVING. THIS OCCURRED BOTH TIMES WHILE TURNING ON A CITY STREET AT AN INTERSECTION. VEHICLE BROUGHT TO DEALERSHIP SAME DAY OF SECOND OCCURRENCE. SERVICE DEPARTMENT FOUND NO OIL ON DIPSTICK. OIL CONSUMPTION TEST BEING PERFORMED AT THIS TIME.
DRIVING ON INTERSTATE CAR LOST POWER ALL WARNING LIGHTS WENT ON THEN DIED COASTED TO SIDE OF ROAD COULD NOT RESTART CAR HAD ABOUT 1/8 TANK GAS DOT CAME AND PUT IN SOME MORE GAS RESTARTED WENT TO GAS STATION AND OIL CHANGE SHOP THAT COULD NOT FIND ANYTHING TO REPAIR RESET WARNING LIGHTS

ALTIMA'S LOW BEAM HEADLIGHTS ARE EXTREMELY DIM. SAME ISSUE AS REPORTED ON OTHER SITES:HTTP://WWW.NISSANPROBLEMS.COM/ALTIMA-PROJECTOR-HEADLIGHTS/  ESSENTIALLY THE INTERNAL LENZ IS DAMAGE OVER TIME AND USE DIRECTING THE LIGHT TOWARDS THE GROUND AND NOT THE ROAD. IT HAS BEEN A SLOW PROGRESSION AND I DID NOT REALIZE THE ISSUE UNTIL I WENT TO CHANGE THE LAMP BULBS.  
THE FRAME OF THE 2004 4RUNNER IS RUSTING OUT AND THERE ARE VISIBLE HOLES IN THE FRAME THAT SUPPORT THE VEHICLE. THIS APPEARS TO BE A VERY COMMON PROBLEM ACCORDING TO THE DEALERSHIP WITH SEVERAL OF THE 4RUNNER AND TACOMA MODELS BEING AFFECTED.
WHEN PULLING OUT OF MY DRIVEWAY THIS MORNING I NOTICED AND ORANGE GLOW AND SMOKE FROM THE BACK WINDOW. IT WAS AN ELECTRICAL FIRE FROM THE BACK DEFROST THAT IS ON RECALL IN CANADA FOR THIS SAME VEHICLE. WHY IS THIS NOT A RECALL IN THE US? WHAT IF I WAS DRIVING AND MY KIDS WERE IN THE CAR? COMPLETELY UNSAFE AND NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED BEFORE ANY ONE GETS HURT.
"WE HAD A FRONT STEERING OSCILLATION, AKA ""DEATH WOOBLE"", OCCUR WILL IN A CURVE AT 55 MPH AFTER A MINOR BUMP.  WE HAD TO SLOW TO 5 MPH BEFORE IT RECOVERED.  THIS WAS ON A 2 LANE ROAD (GA 369) IN FORSYTH CO.  I 'MAY' HAVE VIDEO, BUT I AN NOT SURE I SAVED IT."
"PUT THE CAR IN PARK, IN A DRIVEWAY WITH A SLIGHT INCLINE, TURNED OFF THE IGNITION, AND WENT INTO THE HOUSE. THE CAR ENGAGED AND ROLLED DOWN THE HILL. PULLED IT BACK UP THE DRIVEWAY, AND TWO MORE TIMES PUT IT IN PARK, TURNED OFF THE IGNITION, AND THE CAR ENGAGED AND ROLLED DOWN THE DRIVEWAY."
ON 12/31/19 WHILE DRIVING ON PCH THE THE WOULD NOT ACCELEBRATE  IT'S LIKE IT IN NEUTRAL VERY DANGEROUS! HAD TO PULL OVER AND GET A TOW HOME. DOESN'T SHIFT GEARS RIGHT. 2018 IT WAS JERKING FIX THE TRANSMISSION NOW THIS. ONLY 71000 MILES ON IT.  !
"BODY PARTS ARE FALLING OF FOR RUNNING BOARDS, PARTS HAVE FALLEN OFF ON THE HIGHWAY AND HIT OTHER VEHICLES. DEALER UNABLE TO FIND PARTS TO RESOLVE ISSUE."
"REAR BACKUP CAMERA SCREEN GETS FUZZY WITH SEVERAL WHITE LINES ACROSS MAINLY DURING NIGHT DRIVING. VERY POOR VISIBILITY FOR A BRAND NEW TRUCK/CAMERA. GOOD VISIBILITY IS CRITICAL FOR BACKING UP IN A CROWDED PARKING LOT AT NIGHT. CRITICAL SAFETY ISSUE!!  TOOK IT TO MY LOCAL DEALER 12/30/19 DURING THE DAY, AND WAS TOLD THEY COULD NOT GET IT TO REPLICATE THE ISSUE, HOWEVER DID KNOW ABOUT THE ISSUE WITH OTHER VEHICLES.  NO RESOLUTION WAS GIVEN, SAID TO COME BACK WHEN IT DID IT AGAIN."
HAD RECALL PERFORMED TO ADDRESS HARD BREAKING AT SLOW SPEEDS.  NOW THE TRUCK IS HARDER TO STOP AT SLOW SPEEDS AND GM WILL NOT FIX THE PROBLEM. THEY KNOW IT'S THE VACUUM PUMP AND BOOSTER AND EXPECT ME TO PAY FOR IT.
"LOSS OF POWER STEERING ASSIST WHEN FIRST STARTING THE VEHICLE.  A MESSAGE IS DISPLAYED ON THE INFO PANEL IN THE CENTER OF THE DASH AND ALL STEERING CAPABILITY IS LOST.  IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO TURN THE STEERING WHEEL WHEN THIS HAPPENS.  BOTH TIMES THE VEHICLE HAS BEEN STATIONARY AND I'VE BEEN ABLE TO CORRECT THE PROBLEM BY DISCONNECTING THE BATTERY AND THEN RECONNECTING IT.  I'VE REPORTED THIS ISSUE TO THE LOCAL CHEVROLET SERVICE CENTER AND THEY TOLD ME TO CONTINUE MONITORING THE PROBLEM.  I'M OBVIOUSLY CONCERNED THAT THIS WILL HAPPEN WHEN I'M DRIVING, SINCE, LIKE I'VE ALREADY MENTIONED, YOU COMPLETELY LOSE THE ABILITY TO TURN THE STEERING WHEEL.  OTHER MESSAGES POP AS WELL.  ""TRACTION CONTROL SYSTEM REQUIRES SERVICING."" ""TRAILER BRAKE REQUIRES SERVICING."" MANY OF THE ELECTRICAL FEATURES ON THE DASH QUIT WORKING."

"THE VEHICLE HAS HAD ONGOING ISSUES SINCE IT WAS PURCHASED IN JUNE OF 2017. THE 'SHIFT TO PARK' PROBLEM HAD TO BE FIXED TWICE, THE EMERGENCY BRAKING SYSTEM ENGAGES ITSELF FOR NO APPARENT REASON WHICH HAS ALMOST CAUSED SEVERAL ACCIDENTS, THE HORN DOES NOT WORK WHEN NEEDED IN EMERGENCY SITUATIONS, THE HEADLIGHTS ARE SO DIM IT'S DANGEROUS, THE BATTERY HAS DRAINED AND LEFT MY WIFE STRANDED 4 TIMES, AND THE VEHICLE HAS A VERY ROUGH IDLE AND IT ALMOST STALLS OUT.  I ATTEMPTED TO WORK WITH GM TO HAVE THEM TAKE THE CAR BACK EARLY (LEASE) AND THE REQUEST WAS RECENTLY DENIED.  THIS IS MY 3RD ACADIA AND IT BY FAR IS THE MOST DANGEROUS CAR I HAVE EVER DRIVEN.  I AM NOW READING ABOUT A FUEL PUMP PROBLEM THAT COULD CAUSE THE VEHICLE TO CATCH ON FIRE, A DRIVESHAFT THAT MAY SEPARATE WHILE DRIVING, AND A FAULTY BRAKING SYSTEM THAT COULD CAUSE THE VEHICLE TO LOSE ALL BRAKING CAPABILITY.

"ON JULY 7, 2015, I BOUGHT  4 TIRES 117632 AFFINITY TOURING BL P195/60R15 87T WITH A 70,0000 MILE WARRANTY.  I PAID $415.58 WHICH INCLUDED FOUR OF THE BEFORE MENTIONED TIRES; NEVADA RECYCLING FEE; LIFETIME NEW TIRE WHEEL BALANCE LABOR; LIFETIME RUBBER VALVE; SCRAP TIRE RECYCLING FEE; AND TIRE INSTALLATION.  I BOUGHT THESE TIRES AT FIRESTONE COMPLETE AUTO CARE GREEN VALLEY 220 NORTH STEPHANIE STREET, HENDERSON, NEVADA 89074, PHONE#702-434-0692.  I HAD 59,284 MILES ON MY CAR.  ON DECEMBER 31, 2019, BECAUSE OF THE TIRES GOING FLAT AND THE WEAR BAR TOO LOW FOR ME TO DRIVE SAFELY ON THESE TIRES, I HAD TO BUY FOUR NEW TIRES.  I HAD 106,125 MILES. I STILL HAD 23,159 MILES LEFT ON MY 70,000 MILES WARRANTY.  I BOUGHT 4 114572 PRIMEWELL PS830 195/60R 15 88HBL DOT#Y9K5D8HK3210 TIRES PRIE $47.99.  THE FIRESTONE LOCATED AT 1323 BOULDER CITY PARKWAY, BOULDER CITY, NEVADA 89005 PHONE#294-0098 GAVE ME A CREDIT OF $26.80 FOR ALL FOUR TIRES CHARGING $41.29 FOR EACH TIRE.  I PAID A TOTAL OF $303.20 FOR THESE TIRES.  I AM VERY UPSET THAT I HAD TO BUY CHEAPER TIRES BECAUSE THE BETTER TIRES I BOUGHT DID NOT LAST THE FULL $70,000 MILES."

"AFTER EXTENSIVE TRIPS TO THE MAINTENANCE SHOP (PEPBOYS) MY SANTA FE IS NOW NEEDING TO GET THE ENGINE REBUILT. THE CAUSE SO I AM TOLD IS A FAILED OIL PUMP IN THE ENGINE.   I WAS PICKED UP AFTER HAVING TO GO BACK THE THE SHOP BECAUSE IT WOULD NOT START. IT WAS TOWED IN TO PEPBOYS, AND THEY TOLD ME IT WAS A ONE OFF WITH THE STARTER AND ALL WAS GOOD NOW. I PICKED UP THE SUV AND DROVE IT OUT OF THE PARKING LOT DOWN THE STREET ONLY TO HAVE THE ENGINE SHUT OFF MID DRIVE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD. IT WAS TOWED BACK INTO PEPBOYS AND NOW THEY ARE TELLING ME IT IS A OIL PUMP FAILURE AND THE ENGIN IS LOCKED UP AND IT NEEDS TO BE REBUILT. IS THIS A FACTORY ISSUE"

"MY VEHICLE IS SUFFERING FROM AN EXTREMELY COMMON PROBLEM WITHIN THE 4TH GENERATION CRV - THE VTC ACTUATOR IS MAKING A GRINDING NOISE DURING COLD STARTUPS. THERE IS A ACTIVE BULLETIN REGARDING THE ISSUE, TSB 16-012 VER. 2.     THE ISSUE IS FURTHER COMPOUNDED BY THE FACT THAT IT DOES NOT HAPPEN LITERALLY EVERY SINGLE TIME I TURN THE CAR ON. IT ONLY HAPPENS SOMETIMES. THE DEALERSHIP TOLD ME TO LEAVE IT WITH THEM OVERNIGHT. THEN IN THE MORNING THEY WILL TEST IT AND TRY TO DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM. IF THEY CAN'T DUPLICATE IT, THEN THEY WON'T FIX IT. THIS IS FRUSTRATING.   "
"STEERING WHEEL IS HARD TO TURN WHILE DRIVING.BECAUSE OF HARD STEERING WHEEL, IT IS HARD TO TURN. I FEEL RISKY WHILE TURNING BECAUSE THERE WOULD BE A CHANCES THAT IT WON'T TURN IN TIME AND WOULD HAVE THE RISK OF COLLISION."

"WHEN BREAKING FOLLOWING AN ABS EVENT, THE BRAKE PEDAL SINKS ALMOST TO THE FLOOR BEFORE STOPPING THE CAR.  THIS CONDITION PERSISTS FOR AN INDETERMINATE AMOUNT OF TIME (MINUTES TO DAYS) BEFORE SELF-CORRECTING.  I HAVE EXPERIENCED THIS ON MULTIPLE OCCASIONS OVER ABOUT TWO YEARS.  I HAVE EXPERIENCED IT AFTER HARD BRAKING ON SNOWY/ICY ROADS AND AFTER HITTING POT HOLES.  THIS APPEARS TO BE THE SAME CONDITION AS REPORTED IN RECALL 19S54 (ABS VALVE MAY REMAIN OPEN AFTER ABS EVENT) WHICH  DOES NOT COVER MY CAR'S MODEL YEAR.  MY MECHANIC HAS DONE THE FOLLOWING WORK WHICH HAS NOT FIXED THE PROBLEM:  INSTALLED NEW FRONT AND BACK CALIPERS, PADS, AND ROTORS, COMPLETELY FLUSHED BRAKE FLUID, AND BLED ANTI-LOCK BRAKES USING INSTRUCTIONS IN THE FORD IDS SCAN TOOL."
"WHEN I HIT A BUMP WITH MY JEEP, THE STEERING WHEEL SHIMMIES  OR WOBBLES. WHEN THIS HAPPENS I AM UNABLE TO STEER THE VEHICLE. TO MAKE IT STOP I NEED TO BRING THE VEHICLE TO A COMPLETE STOP."
NONE OF CONTROLS ON STEERING COLUMN ARE WORKING.  FIRST THE CRUISE CONTROL STOPPED..  REPLACED THE FUSE IT LOOKED BURNT OUT.  DID NOT SOLVE.

THE CAR SHAKES AT LOW SPEED. TRANSMISSION IS BAD.

"RECENTLY WHILE DRIVING ON THE FREEWAY AT SPEEDS RANGING FROM 60 AND ABOVE, WE HAVE EXPERIENCED SEVERE SHAKING ON THE 2016 JEEP WRANGLER SAHARA UNLIMITED THAT CAUSES US TO PULL OVER AND COME TO A STOP WHILE STILL ON THE HIGHWAY. SHAKING HAS OCCURRED ON NOVEMBER 24TH, 2019 AFTER DRIVING OVER POTHOLES/ROAD JOINTS ON THE FREEWAY; AND AGAIN, ON DECEMBER 26, 2019 ON A STRAIGHT SURFACE ON THE FREEWAY. ONE HAS TO HOLD ON TIGHT TO THE STEERING WHEEL SO AS TO KEEP FROM VEERING OUT OF CONTROL AND ONTO ANOTHER VEHICLE/ROAD SEPARATOR BECAUSE THE JEEP'S TIRES BEGIN TO SWERVE SIDE TO SIDE RAPIDLY. THE SWERVING TIRES CAUSES THE JEEP TO RATTLE AND BECOME JUMPY. THE SEVERE SHAKING ALSO FEELS AS IF A TIRE IS COMING OFF AND WILL BREAK DOWN THEN AND THERE. SLOWING ONE'S SPEED AND SLOWLY PRESSING ON THE BREAK HELPS SLOW AND EVENTUALLY STOP THE SHAKING ONCE COMPLETELY STOPPED. I DO NOT FEEL SAFE DRIVING THE JEEP AND MUST BE EXTRA ATTENTIVE AT ALL TIMES NOW FOR FEAR OF LOSING CONTROL. THE ROOT OF THE PROBLEM IS UNKNOWN."

"RAV4 HAS BEEN MAINTAINED PER TOYOTA'S RECOMMENDATIONS.  AT APPROX 86K MILES IT STARTED USING UP EXCESSIVE AMOUNTS OF OIL.  OIL IS NOT LEAKING, NOR BURNING (CAN'T SEE ANYTHING IN THE TAIL PIPES), AND THERE'S NO BURN OIL SMELL ANYWHERE.  AFTER RESEARCHING, I FOUND THAT IN 2011, TOYOTA ISSUED TSB-0094-11 THAT ACKNOWLEDGED EXCESSIVE OIL CONSUMPTION IN MY YEAR VEHICLE.   TOYOTA ALSO ISSUED A LSC ZE7 WHICH OFFERED FREE REPAIR FOR QUALIFIED VEHICLES DURING THE CAMPAIGN (11/24/2017 OR 150K MILES WHICHEVER CAME FIRST).  UNFORTUNATELY MY CAR JUST HIT 86K MILES.  I'M THE 2ND OWNER AND NEVER GOT ANY NOTIFICATION.  MY CAR IS BURNING ABOUT 1 QUART PER 1,000 MILES.  AFTER SPEAKING TO TOYOTA CUST NO-SVC, THEY'RE NOT WILLING TO DO ANYTHING.  EVEN THOUGH THEY ACKNOWLEDGE THERE'S AN ISSUE!!! MY CASE WITH TOYOTA IS 1912311193.  FROM MY ONLINE RESEARCH I'VE SEEN MANY PEOPLE IMPACTED THAT HAVE NOT BEEN HELPED BY TOYOTA.  THIS IS JUST NOT RIGHT.  TOYOTA HAS KEPT THIS VERY QUIET."

IT HAS BEEN LOOKED AT BY 2 DIFFERENT ENGINEERS  DUE TO THE BBB COMPLAINT THAT WAS FILED. THE CAR IS A LEMON ACCORDING TO TEXAS LEMON LAW BUT FORD WILL NOT RECOGNIZE THE PROBLEM SINCE THEY CANNOT FORCE AND INTERMITTENT PROBLEM TO PRESENT ITSELF.

THEY SAID THAT IT WAS SEIZED AND IF I HAD BEEN ON THE FREEWAY, IT COULD'VE BEEN CATASTROPHIC. AFTER SOME RESEARCH, I FOUND A PROPOSAL FOR THE SETTLEMENT OF A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT INCLUDING MANY HYUNDAI AND KIA CARS. THE SETTLEMENT INCLUDED ALL HYUNDAI SONATA VEHICLES YEARS 2011-2018 AND SOME 2019 VEHICLES. MY CAR IS CLEARLY ONE OF THE CARS AFFECTED. I AM SEEKING HELP FROM THE NHTSA SO THAT HYUNDAI CAN TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR CARELESS MISTAKES THAT HAVE ALREADY RESULTED IN MANY ACCIDENTS AND CAR FIRES. A HYUNDAI DEALERSHIP WILL BE LOOKING AT MY CAR ON JANUARY, 6TH 2020. I'M ANTICIPATING THEM TRYING TO BRUSH THIS UNDER THE RUG AND BLAMING THE ISSUES ON ME DESPITE HAVING THE CAR FOR ONLY 90 DAYS AFTER PURCHASE ALONG WITH THE ABUNDANT KNOWLEDGE OF HYUNDAI AND KIA KNOWINGLY USING FAULTY ENGINES. I NEED YOUR HELP TO ENSURE THEY FIX THEIR MISTAKES AT NO COST TO ME AND OTHER OWNERS.

THIS ROUGH RUNNING WAS ONLY INTERMITTENT AND EVENTUALLY SUBSIDED.  ROUGH RUNNING ENGINE RETURNED ALONG WITH WHAT I CONSIDERED A ""ROD KNOCK"".  WE IMMEDIATELY PARKED THE VEHICLE AND DID NOT USE IT AFTER FIRST NOTICING THE KNOCK.  VEHICLE TOWED BACK TO DEALERSHIP WHO PERFORMED RECALL.  DEALERSHIP INFORMS US THAT THE ENGINE IS ""DESTROYED"" (THEIR WORDS).  DEALERSHIP CLAIMS ROD BEARING OR BEARINGS DAMAGED DUE TO ""OIL STARVATION"".  DEALERSHIP QUOTES US $17,000 TO REPAIR VEHICLE, INCLUDING A REPLACEMENT SHORT BLOCK.  WE REFUSE DEALERSHIP'S OFFER AND ASK THAT THEY LEAVE ENGINE OUT OF THE VEHICLE.  DEALERSHIP PLACES ENGINE BACK INTO OUR VEHICLE AND SETS THE DRIVER'S SIDE HEADS IN THE TRUNK WITH OTHER VARIOUS PARTS PLACED ON THE BACK SEAT (NICE TOUCH).  WE HAVE VEHICLE TOWED BACK TO OUR HOME.  WE LOCATED A SUBARU MECHANIC IN OUR TOWN, REMOVE ENGINE FROM VEHICLE, TAKE ENGINE TO SAID MECHANIC WHO IS GOING TO INSPECT FOR DAMAGE, BALANCE, REBUILD, AND INSTALL THE ENGINE BACK INTO OUR VEHICLE.  MECHANIC'S COST = $6,400.  UPON OUR PARTIAL TEARDOWN OF ENGINE I FOUND, WHAT I CONSIDER, AN EXCESSIVE AMOUNT OF RUBBERY COMPOUND ON THE FRONT CASE OF THE ENGINE.  I ALSO FOUND THIS SAME TYPE OF RUBBERY COMPOUND COVERING A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THE OIL PICK UP TUBE SCREEN.  I DO NOT KNOW THE CONDITION OF THE OILING PASSAGES WITHIN THE BLOCK.  WE FOUND VERY LITTLE METALLIC MATERIAL IN THE OIL PAN.  I AM SUSPICIOUS THAT THIS RUBBERY COMPOUND MADE ITS WAY INTO THE OIL AND CLOGGED OILING PASSAGES.  DEALERSHIP IS DENYING ALL.  MY COMPLAINT?:  DEALERSHIP WAS OVER AGGRESSIVE IN THEIR USE OF SEALANT, CLOGGING OIL PASSAGES AND CAUSING OIL STARVATION TO THE BEARINGS.  THEN, DENYING RESPONSIBILITY AND QUOTING A HIGH DOLLAR AMOUNT TO REPAIR"

"THE NISSAN ROGUE HAS A CVT TRANSMISSION, WHICH IS KNOWN TO FAIL. AND HAS TO REPLACES AND NOT REPAIRED OR REBUILT."
I WAS DRIVING DOWN THE HIGHWAY WITH THE SEAT WARMER ACTIVATED. THE SEAT WAS VERY WARM AND I FELT SOMETHING POKING ME. I REACHED BEHIND ME TO SEE WHAT WAS POKING ME AND SOMETHING BURNED MY FINGER. I STOPPED AT THE GAS STATION AND SAW THAT A HOLE HAD BEEN BURNED IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT. A HOLE HAD ALSO BEEN BURNED THROUGH MY WINDBREAKER AND HAD STARTED BURNING MY SHIRT.
I BROUGHT MY CAR TO A LOCAL GARAGE WHEN THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON.  THE MECHANIC HAD SPENT OVER 5 HOURS TAKING OUR CAR APART ONCE HE FOUND THAT SOME OF THE BOLTS ON THE CAMSHAFT WERE BROKEN AND HAD FALLEN IN THE ENGINE AS FAR AS THE OIL PAN.  I CALLED BMW AND THEY SAID THAT ALTHOUGH THERE WAS AN EXTENDED RECALL ON THIS THAT THE WOULD NOT COVER ANY OF THE EXPENSES FOR THIS MAJOR REPAIR WHICH WAS OVER $5500!  THEY WOULD HAVE COVERED THE REPAIR IF I BROUGHT THE CAR INTO ONE OF THEIR SERVICE CENTERS.  I WOULD HAVE HAD TO PAY MY LOCAL GARAGE THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS TO GIVE ME THE CAR IN PIECES AND HAVE IS TOWED TO BMW.  I TOLD MY MECHANIC TO COMPLETE THE REPAIR AND I WOULD ATTEMPT TO FIGHT BMW.  CONTACTING YOU  IS MY FIRST STEP IN FIGHT BMW.  I WILL ALSO LOOK INTO A CLASS ACTION THAT MAY HAVE STARTED AGAINST THEM AND JOIN IT
"MY CAR SHUT OFF/THE ENGINE LOST POWER, WHILE SITTING IN TRAFFIC. I FELT A SLIGHT ROUGH IDLE, THEN REALIZED ALL MY DASH LIGHTS WERE ON, AND THE ENGINE WAS NOT RUNNING. I PLACED THE CAR IN PARK, AND PUSHED THE ENGINE START BUTTON. CAR STARTED BACK UP, BUT EVERY TIME I STOPPED I HAD TO PLACE THE CAR IN PARK AND KEEP MY FOOT SLIGHTLY ON THE GAS TO KEEP IT FROM IDLING ROUGHLY AND SHUTTING OFF AGAIN. I HAD TO DO THIS FOR A HALF HOUR UNTIL I REACHED MY DESTINATION. AFTER SETTING FOR 4 HOURS THE CAR STARTED FINE AND I HAD NOT FURTHER ISSUES. BUT MY FEAR IS THAT IT WILL HAPPEN AGAIN WHILE IN TRAFFIC OR POSSIBLY WHILE DRIVING, WHICH COULD CAUSE AN ACCIDENT."
REAR SUSPENSION CONTROL ARM FAILURE. LEFT BACK DRIVER SIDE. RUSTED AND BROKE.
I WAS TRAVELING DOWN A CITY STREET AND THE PERSON COMING THE OTHER DIRECTION CROSSED THE DOUBLE YELLOW LINE. WE COLLIDED HEAD ON AND MY AIRBAG DID NOT DEPLOY.   I HAD RECENTLY REPLACED THE AIRBAG DUE TO A RECALL FROM THE MANUFACTURER.   THIS ACCIDENT RESULTED IN MY VEHICLE BEING TOTALED. FURTHERMORE I RECEIVED SEVERAL INJURIES INCLUDING A CONCUSSION AND WHIPLASH.   THE AIRBAG DID DEPLOY ON THE KIA THAT HIT ME.
STEERING GEAR WENT OUT (POWER STEERING) HAS GONE GONE OUT TWICE AND CURRENTLY REPLACED TWICE.
"WHILE DRIVING MY 2015 MAZDA CX-9 ON A VERY BUSY INTERSTATE, THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT APPEARED ON THE DRIVER PANEL.  I WAS TRAVELING WITH MY VERY YOUNG CHILDREN, AGES 4 AND 20 MONTHS. APPROXIMATELY 10 MILES LATER, I STARTED HEARING A RATTLING SOUND UNDER THE HOOD.  SHORTLY THEREAFTER, MY CAR STALLED OUT AS I ENTERED MY SUBDIVISION.   MY HUSBAND HAD TO PUSH THE CAR TO OUR DRIVEWAY.  I CALLED AAA THAT SAME DAY AND HAD THE CAR TOWED TO THE DEALERSHIP THAT SERVICES THE VEHICLE.  I WAS TOLD THAT THE WATER PUMP NEEDED TO BE REPLACED AND WAS QUOTED A PRICE TO FIX THE ISSUE.  LATER, I WAS TOLD THAT AFTER FURTHER INSPECTION BY THE DEALERSHIP THAT THE COOLANT MIXED WITH FLUIDS AND THE ENGINE NEEDED TO BE REPLACED.  I WAS QUOTED OVER $7000 TO COMPLETE THIS WORK.  DURING THE COURSE OF MY RESEARCH, I HAVE LEARNED THAT A LOT OF MAZDA CUSTOMERS WHO HAVE THIS MODEL VEHICLE EXPERIENCE THIS ISSUE QUITE FREQUENTLY.  I CALLED MAZDA CUSTOMER CARE AND WAS TOLD THAT MAZDA IS NOT ELECTING TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS ISSUE.  I WAS FORTUNATE THAT I WAS ABLE TO ARRIVE TO MY SUBDIVISION WITHOUT INJURING MY CHILDREN OR SELF, BUT THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE THAT COULD RESULT IN THE LOSS OF LIVES IF NOT CORRECTED IMMEDIATELY."

"THE CAR'S IDLE STOP IS NOT WORKING PROPERLY. THE RADIO CONSISTENTLY DROPS OUT AND HEADLIGHTS FLICKER WHEN RELEASING THE BRAKE TO START THE CAR AFTER IDLE STOP WAS ENGAGED. MULTIPLE TIMES THE CAR HAS NOW FAILED TO START AND APPEARS TO STALL OUT, AND MAKES ME SHUTOFF THE WHOLE CAR AND RESTART IT. THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE AS SOME PEOPLE DO NOT REALIZE AND MIGHT REAR END ME. I HAVE TAKEN IT TO MY LOCAL DEALER, BEEN TOLD THEY CANNOT REPLICATE IT INITIALLY, TO THEM VALIDATING THE ISSUE AND WANTING ME TO BRING IT BACK. I DON'T HAVE CONFIDENCE IN THEM FIXING THE ISSUE AT THIS POINT AS THEY DO NOT HAVE FAMILIARITY WITH IT, YET I SEE MANY COMPLAINTS ABOUT IT ONLINE. I FEEL THIS PROBLEM IS MORE WIDESPREAD THAN HONDA IS COMMUNICATING AND THE CAR HAS A FAULT IN THE AUTO IDLE STOP DESIGN THAT THEY ARE NOT RESOLVING."
THE DASHBOARD IS CRACKING AND FALLING IN ALL AROUND THE AIRBAGS AND INSTRUMENT CLUSTER . IF THE TRUCK IS EVER IN A WRECK THE PIECES CAN INJURE OR CAUSE DEATH TO THE DRIVER AND PASSENGERS
"DRIVERS SIDE SEAT BELT DOES NOT RETRACT. AS A RESULT I TESTED IT BY INSERTING THE BUCKLE AND PULLED ON THE BELT QUICKLY/SHARPLY TO DETERMINE IF IT WOULD LOCK UP.  WHILE THE PASSENGER SIDE RETRACTS AND LOCKS UP, THE DRIVER SIDE DOES NOT. DON'T BELIEVE THE SEAT BELT WOULD RESTRAIN THE DRIVER IN AN ACCIDENT. MY WIFE DRIVES THE CAR AND SAID THIS BEGAN ABOUT 6 MONTHS AGO.  I WAS UNAWARE OF THIS UNTIL RECENTLY."

IN THE MORNING WHEN I STARTED THE VEHICLE, IT GAVE ME ERRORS IN ALL SYSTEMS: BRAKE SYSTEM ERROR, POWER STEERING ERROR, TIRE PRESSURE ERROR, ETC. I COULD SHIFT THE GEAR, BUT STEERING WHEEL WOULD NOT TURN. I TOWED A CAR TO A HONDA DEALERSHIP AND THEY TOLD ME AN ELECTRIC POWER STEERING PUMP NEEDS TO BE REPLACED. THE CAR IS 3.5 YEARS OLD, 36000 MILES, THE WARRANTY ENDED ONLY 6 MONTH AGO. HONDA PROVIDED AN ESTIMATE OF $1500 TO FIX THE PROBLEM. IN A FEW DAYS WHEN I WAS SUPPOSE TO PICK UP THE VEHICLE, HONDA CALLED ME SAYING THAT THEY WEREN'T ABLE TO FIX THE PROBLEM AND NOW THEY NEED TO REPLACE A POWER STEERING RACK AND POWER STEERING MOTOR AND IT WOULD COST $3000.

I OWN A VEHICLE WITH TAKATA AIRBAG INFLATORS.  THEY HAVE BEEN UNDER RECALL SINCE 2017 AND THE RECALL HAS NOT BEEN TAKEN CARE OF BECAUSE TAKATA HAS FILED BANKRUPTCY AND GM DOES NOT HAVE A SOLUTION OR REMEDY APPARENTLY FOR THE RECALL!!!   I NEED MY VEHICLE RECALL TO BE FIXED IMMEDIATELY!   WHO'S TO KNOW IF MY AIRBAG INFLATORS ARE COMPROMISED AND I AM ANGRY THAT GM WILL NOT STEP UP AND FIND A SOLUTION AND PAY FOR THE RECALL!!    MY SAFETY AND THAT OF MY FAMILY IS AT RISK!!    WHY HASNT THIS RECALL ON AIRBAG INFLATORS BEEN REMEDIED??    ITS BEEN 3 YEARS!   IT'S RIDICULOUS AND I AM ANGRY THAT GM DOES NOT VALUE THE SAFETY OF IT'S CUSTOMERS BY ENSURING SWIFT ACTION ON RECALLS!

MY TRUCK IS EXPERIENCING DEATH WOBBLE.  WHEN I DRIVE AND THE TRUCK HITS A ROUGH PATCH OR BUMP IN THE ROAD THE STEERING CREATES A WOBBLE SO BAD THAT THE WHOLE TRUCK SHAKES.  THE WHEEL MOVES BACK AND FORTH UNCONTROLLABLY AND I HAVE TO SLOW DOWN TO ABOUT 40 MPH OR LESS FOR IT TO STOP.  ON THE INTERSTATE PULLING A 5TH WHEEL CAMPER THIS IS A EXTREMELY DANGEROUS CONDITION FOR BOTH MY FAMILY AND OTHER CARS ON THE ROAD.  WHEN THE DEATH WOBBLE IS HAPPENING IT SCARES MY FAMILY TO THE POINT OF WANTING TO GET OUT OF THE TRUCK.  SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH THE STEERING OR ALIGNMENT OF THESE TRUCKS.  I SEE THAT FORD HAS CREATED A COUPLE OF SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENTS TO TRY TO FIX THIS PROBLEM BUT ARE UNSUCCESSFUL.  FORD HAS SO MANY SERVICE ISSUES TO CORRECT THIS PROBLEM THAT PARTS ARE ON BACK ORDER.  THEY ARE PUTTING A BAND-AID ON THE ISSUE INSTEAD OF TRYING TO FIX THE PROBLEM.
"THE REAR POWER LOCKS ARE INOPERATIVE AT TIMES- WHEN USING THE KEYLESS ENTRY AND THE MASTER SWITCH.

"DRIVING ON A LOCAL MAJOR ROAD THE BRAKES DID NOT WORK, BRAKES WENT LOW AND CAR WOULD NOT STOP. PUMPING DID NOT HELP. WENT THROUGH 2 LIGHTS. NO ACCIDENT. TOOK CAR TO SERVICE STATION, THEY COULD NOT FIND THE PROBLEM. CAR WORKS FINE NOW BUT I'M WORRIED ABOUT IT HAPPENING AGAIN."
"ON DECEMBER 10TH, 2019, AS I WAS DRIVING HOME FROM WORK ON INTERSTATE 694 IN ARDEN HILLS MN, THE ENGINE STARTED MAKING A GRINDING NOISE, AND THEN EVENTUALLY STALLED. NO WARNING LIGHTS INDICATING A PROBLEM EVER CAME ON. I HAD IT TOWED TO THE NEAREST CHEVROLET DEALERSSHIP, AND 2 DAYS LATER WAS INFORMED BY THEM THAT THE ENGINE HAD RUN OUT OF OIL, AND I WOULD NEED A NEW ENGINE THAT WOULD COST ME $8500. AFTER DOING SOME RESEARCH ON THE INTERNET, I DISCOVERED THAT EXCESSIVE OIL CONSUMPTION IS A KNOWN ISSUE WITH THIS MOTOR, THE 2.4L ECOTEC. THERE ARE MANY COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS ON THE INTERNET. A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT FILED AGAINST GM RESULTED IN A $42 MILLION JUDGEMENT AGAINST GM, BUT IT ONLY COVERED MODEL YEARS 2010-2013. A 2ND CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT HAS BEEN FILED AGAINST GM TO COVER MODEL YEARS 2014-2017, THIS LAWSUIT IS STILL WORKING IT'S WAY THROUGH THE COURTS. GM HAS REFUSED TO REPAIR MY VEHICLE AT THEIR EXPENSE, EVEN THOUGH THIS IS A WIDELY KNOWN PROBLEM WITH THIS ENGINE. INFORMATION ON THESE LAWSUITS CAN BE FOUND AT WWW.CLASSACTION.ORG, AND  WWW.CARCOMPLAINTS.COM. I AM ASKING THAT GM REPAIR MY VEHICLE AT THEIR EXPENSE, NOTHING MORE, NOTHING LESS."

I HAD IT TOWED TO LUTHER KIA IN BLOOMONGTON MG.  THERE IT WAS CONFIRMED THAT I NEEDED A NEW ENGINE.   AT 149,000 MILES I WAS SURPRISED.   THERE WAS NOTHING THAT GAVE ME INDICSTION THAT THERE WAS A PROBLEM.   NO LIGHTS ON THE DASH OR ANYTHING EXCEPT FOR THE TICKING AN HOUR BEFORE.    KIA WAS CONTACTED AND DENIED ANY CLAIM OR RESPONSIBILITY.   ON FURTHER CHECKING I FOUND THAT I WAS NOT ALONE IN THE ENGINE TROUBLE.   THE 2013 KIA SHORTAGE HAS HAD MANY OTHER INCIDENTS AND COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE ENGINE.   MANY OF THE  STORIES WE EXACTLY LIKE MINE.   PEOPLE DRIVING DOWN A HIGHWAY AND THE ENGINE DIED.   PEOPLE COULD HAVE BEEN KILLED. 2013 KIA SHORTAGE OWNERS SHOULD BE MADE AWARE OF THIS PROBLEM.    SHAME IN KIA FOR NOT STEPPING UP AND TAKING RESPONSIBILITY,       DEBRA.   WISCONSIN"

"ON A TRIP THE CAR BEGAN JERKING AND LOSING ACCELERATION WITH THE ENGINE RUNNING AT HIGH REVS (5-6K) ON THE HIGHWAY.  EVENTUALLY THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON AND THE CAR WAS NOT ABLE TO MAINTAIN SPEED OR ACCELERATE.  THE CAR WAS TOWED TO KIA DEALERSHIP IN READING, PA, 150 MILES FROM MY HOUSE.  AFTER 3 DAYS OF EVALUATION, I WAS INFORMED THE CAR WILL NEED A NEW TRANSMISSION.  THE EXPECTED TIME TO COMPLETE THE REPAIR IS 6 WEEKS.   THE CAR HAS 10K MILES ON IT AND DID NOT HAVE ANY ISSUES PRIOR TO THIS INCIDENT."
I WAS DRIVING GOING ABOUT 45 WHEN MY JEEP OUT OF NOWHERE STOPPED AND WOULDN'T GO FAST THEN 20MPH. SO THEN I GOT A CODE READER AND IT SAID IT WAS THE POWERTRAIN.  WHICH MAKES THEN ENGINE NOT WANT TO GO.
"TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2014 CADILLAC SRX. WHILE DRIVING AT NIGHT, THE LOW BEAM HEADLIGHTS DID NOT FUNCTION PROPERLY AND THE ILLUMINATION WAS TOO LOW WITHOUT WARNING. THE CONTACT HAD TO ACTIVATE THE HIGH BEAMS IN ORDER TO SEE THE ROAD. THE DEALER AND MANUFACTURER WERE NOT CONTACTED. THE VEHICLE WAS NOT REPAIRED. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS APPROXIMATELY 59,280. THE VIN WAS UNKNOWN."
"I HAVE A 2016 GMC ACADIA, WITH 30,000 MILES, WELL MAINTAINED.  SUDDENLY MY STEERING WHEEL IS LOCKED WHILE MAKING TURNS AT A LOW SPEED.   THIS WAS VERY SCARY AS MY WHEEL WAS COMPLETELY LOCKED AND I HAD KIDS IN MY CAR.  VEHICLES RUNNING GOOD WHEN AT HIGH SPEED. I HAVE SEEN SO MANY COMPLAIN WITH THE SAME MODEL AND SAME ISSUE, YET, GMC HAS NOT POSTED ANY RECALL ON THEIR VERY DANGEROUS ISSUE."
WHEN TRUCK IS AT LOW RPM (USUALLY TURNING INTO PARKING SPOT SLOWLY) TRUCK WILL SHUT OFF. ITS PULLING TO MUCH POWER FROM CPU OR ALTERNATOR AND KILLING TRUCK. THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE.

EGR HAS A PROBLEM. WHICH MAY CAUSE A FIRE AND MOPAR DOESN'T HAVE A FIX FOR IT .  THEY DON'T KNOW WHEN THEY WILL.  I WANT TO TRADE IT FOR A GAS POWERED INSTEAD OF THE DIESEL AND THEY WILL NOT TAKE IT ON TRADE.  IF THEY WOULD THEY WON'T GIVE ME ANY WHERE CLOSE TO WHAT THE PICKUP WOULD BE VALUED.  IT SEEMS THAT THE PROBLEM IS THEIR PROBLEM AND THEY SHOULD NOT PENALIZE THEIR OWN CUSTOMERS.  IT IS REALLY NOT SAFE TO DRIVE IT IF IT HAS THE SYMPTOMS IT HAS AS TO FIRE.  IT IS A ON GOING PROBLEM AS THEY DIDN'T TELL ME WHEN I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE.  SOUNDS LIKE BOEING???
SO THEY (MOPAR/JEEP) HAVE HAD THIS JEEP CLOCK SPRING RECALL ISSUE FOR A WHILE NOW... WE HAVE HAD IT REPLACED TWICE NOW UNDER THE RECALL AND IT IS STILL DOING THE EXACT SAME THING... SO THE RECALL FIX WAS NOTHING BUT A SHAM... IT DID NOT FIX THE PROBLEM AND THE PROBLEM STILL PERSISTS AND I AM NOT FIXING IT FOR A THIRD TIME WHEN THE SOLUTION THEY CAME UP WITH FOR THE RECALL IS NOT A SOLUTION IT JUST MASKS THE PROBLEM FOR A LITTLE WHILE... SO NOW ONCE AGAIN THE CLOCK SPRING IS OUT IN IT AND I AM AT MY WITS END WITH IT!

"I WAS DRIVING DOWN A TWO WAY ROAD WHEN IT STARTED POURING ALL OF A SUDDEN LIKE IT TENDS TO DO WHERE I LIVE. I TURNED ON MY WIPERS AND THEY ONLY WORKED FOR A COUPLE OF MINUTES BEFORE THE PASSENGER SIDE WIPER TURNED PAST THE WINDSHIELD AND GOT STUCK IN THAT POSITION. I COULD NOT SEE A THING AND HAD TO PULL OVER UNTIL THE RAIN STOPPED, THIS IS WAY TOO DANGEROUS. I'M LUCKY THIS DIDN'T HAPPEN WHILE ON THE FREEWAY. I TRIED TO TURN THE WIPERS ON AND THEY WOULD NOT MOVE. WHY HASN'T GM ADDRESSED THIS ISSUE? I READ THAT  THERE WAS A RECALL FOR 2013 MODELS AND IN CANADA THEY RECALLED MODELS UP TO 2016."
"THE REAR DRIVER SIDE WINDOW SHATTERED THIS MORNING FROM HAVING MY REAR DEFROSTER ON. I TURNED MY DEFROSTERS ON BEFORE WORK THIS MORNING AND THEN DROVE APPROX 3 MILES BEFORE HEARING A LOUD SOUND FROM THE TOP REAR OF MY VEHICLE. IT WAS A CLEAR 1 LANE ROAD SO IT WASN'T POSSIBLE FOR ANYTHING TO HAVE HIT ME. EVENTUALLY I SAW THAT THE ENTIRE REAR WINDOW WAS SHATTERED. THE ONLY THING UNIQUE WAS THAT I HAD MY DEFROSTERS ON. I LOOKED ON THE INTERNET TO SEE IF THIS COULD HAVE BEEN THE CAUSE AND QUICKLY REALIZED THAT THIS IS A KNOWN ISSUE REPORTED MY MANY PEOPLE. HOWEVER, IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE FORD WILL ACCEPT IT AS THEIR FAULT."

"CAR LOST POWER ON HIGHWAY AND WAS UNABLE TO ACCELERATE.  CHECK ENGINE LIGHT WAS FLASHING.  HAD CAR TOWED TO GERALD KIA NORTH AURORA TO HAVE THEM EVALUATE CAR TO SEE IF IT WAS A RESULT OF THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER RECALL.  IN 9/ 2017 DEALERSHIP ADVISED ME THAT THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER NEEDED REPLACEMENT WITH A STORED ERROR CODE OF P0420.  I WAS TOLD THERE WAS NO RUSH TO REPLACE THE CONVERTER SINCE IT WAS RELATED TO EMISSIONS.  I WAS QUOTED A REPAIR FEE OF $1630.  REPLACED CONVERTER IN 4/2018 AND AGAIN IN 3/2019 AT REPUTABLE SHOP.  DEALERSHIP IS STATING THE CAR IS NOT ELIGIBLE FOR THE RECALL SINCE I AM ""OUT OF WARRANTY"".  CAR WAS DIAGNOSED WITH P3301 AND P3303 FAILURE.  ACCORDING TO RECALL I HAVE A STORED P0420 CODE AND ACTIVE P300X CODES. THEY SHOULD REPLACE THE SHORT BLOCK ACCORDING TO THE RECALL DOCUMENTS. DEALERSHIP IS REFUSING TO ISSUE A TECH LINE AND HONOR RECALL.  NOHERE ON THE PAPERWORK DOES IT STATE THAT THE VEHICLE NEEDS TO BE IN ""WARRANTY""- IF THAT WAS THE CASE WHY DID THEY INFORM ME IN 9/2019 THERE WAS A RECALL AND MY COMPUTER SOFTWARE NEEDED TO BE UPDATED.- I WOULD BE OUT OF ""WARRANTY"" NOWHERE ON THE RECALL PAPERWORK KIA FILED DOES IT STATE THAT ONLY KIA CAN REPLACE A CATALYTIC CONVERTER. VERY FRUSTRATING THAT THE DEALERSHIP IS NOT CONSUMER DRIVEN.  I HAVE ESCALATED THIS TO KIA CORPORATE AND AM WAITING FOR THEIR RESPONSE TO SEE IF THEY WILL HONOR THEIR RECALL."

THE DISTANCE TO THE CAR IN FRONT WAS DEFINITELY INCREASING HOWEVER MY CAR WENT INTO EMERGENCY BRAKING MODE, CANCELLING MY ACCELERATION PEDAL ACTION AND STOPPING THE CAR.

I PURCHASED MY VEHICLE LATE MARCH - EARLY APRIL 2019 AND WAS NOT NOTIFIED OF ANY SORT OF RECALL CONCERNING THIS ISSUE.

"MY CAR WHEN PUT INTO DRIVE WOULD MAKE A CLUNKING NOISE AND LUNGE FORWARD, ALSO WHEN UP SHIFTING AND DOWN SHIFTING IT WOULD BE HARSH AND CLUNK. I TOOK IT THE FORD DEALER AND THEY SAID I NEEDED A REBUILT TRANSMISSION PUT IN AT A PRICE OF $5490, BECAUSE THE ONE IN IT HAD TO MANY PROBLEMS AND WOULD COST MORE TO FIX THEN THE REBUILT ONE, SO THAT'S WHAT I DID THE CAR ONLY HAD 71438 MILES ON IT."

DURING THIS TIME PERIOD, HYUNDAI REPEATEDLY RETURNED THE CAR TO ME AND CLAIMED THE ISSUE WAS RESOLVED BUT THE ISSUE KEPT REOCCURRING. ON 12/28/19, THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT BEGAN FLASHING AGAIN WITH THE EXACT SAME PROBLEMS EXPERIENCED 5/15/19 AND 5/20/19. THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT APPEARED AS SOON AS I EXITED THE INTERSTATE AND WAS DRIVING ON A CITY STREET. MY CAR WAS RETURNED TO ME ON 12/31/19."

"NEW WA STATE BOOSTER SEAT LAWS REQUIRE YOUTH UP TO 4'9"" TO RIDE IN A BOOSTER SEAT. WE PURCHASED A SEAT FOR OUR MID SIZE VEHICLE, AND PLACED IT IN THE SAFEST PLACE IN THE VEHICLE, MIDDLE REAR. WITH THE BOOSTER SEAT, MY SON WHO IS 4'8"" NOW TILTS AND WOBBLES WITH EVERY TURN MADE BECAUSE HIS CENTER OF GRAVITY IS NO LONGER LOWER DOWN BUT HIGHER UP. THIS CAUSES THE SAFETY BELT TO CONSTANTLY BE ROTATING AROUND HIS BODY, NECK ETC. THIS NEW LAW IS UNSAFE BECAUSE IT CLEARLY DOES NOT TAKE BASIC PHYSICS AND CENTER OF GRAVITY INTO CONSIDERATION. I AM REQUESTING IMMEDIATE INVESTIGATION INTO SAFETY OF ALL BOOSTER SEATS FOR CHILDREN'S USE IN REAR, MIDDLE SEATS IN COMPARISON TO NO BOOSTER OR SIDE-SEATS FOR CHILDREN 4'7"" AND ABOVE.  I BELIEVE IT IS ONLY A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE A CHILD IS SERIOUSLY AND GRAVELY HURT BECAUSE OF THIS HIGHER CENTER OF GRAVITY AND BEING TURNED AND TILTED MUCH MORE EASILY AS A TALLER CHILD.  *DT*JB"

I PLAN TO REACH OUT TO MY LOCAL KIA DEALERSHIP TO HAVE THEM INVESTIGATE, AND HOPEFULLY REPAIR THIS DEFECT ON THEIR DIME.

THIS USUALLY HAPPENS WHEN EITHER THE CAR IS STOPPED AND THEN I GO TO TURN, OR TURNING AT A VERY LOW RATE OF SPEED AROUND A CORNER.  WHEN I PUSH DOWN ON THE GAS PEDAL TO GO, IT TAKES OFF ABRUPTLY OR WITH A SURGE. THIS IS CONCERNING, ESPECIALLY IF A CAR IS FOLLOWING BEHIND ME.  I ALSO NOTICE IT WHEN STOPPED AT A LIGHT, GOING STRAIGHT ALSO BUT NOT NEARLY AS MUCH AS WHEN I AM MAKING A TURN."
"ON FOUR OCCASIONS, THE ELECTRONIC DASHBOARD GOES COMPLETELY BLACK AND WILL STAY THAT WAY FOR QUITE SOMETIME. THE DEALER TOLD ME THAT THE VEHICLE IS 'DOWNLOADING SOFTWARE', BUT THIS HAS HAPPENED ON THE HIGHWAY WITHOUT ANY WARNING FROM M-B. IT HAPPENS AFTER I PARK IT AND THEN RESTARTED IT."

"TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2015 FORD TRANSIT 350. THE CONTACT STATED THAT THE AIR INTAKE WAS MOUNTED ON THE VEHICLE IN A WAY THAT ALLOWED WATER TO GET INSIDE AND RUST OUT THE BOLTS THAT SECURED THE AIR INTAKE IN PLACE. AS A RESULT, ANTI-FREEZE WOULD LEAK AND POSSIBLY CAUSE A FIRE. THE VEHICLE WAS LOSING ANTI-FREEZE AND THE TOP OF THE ENGINE WAS SMOKING WHILE THE VEHICLE WAS IN MOTION.  THE BOLTS HAD COMPLETELY RUSTED AND THE WATER FROZE WHEN THE VEHICLE WAS PARKED. WHEN THE ICE MELTED AND THE ENGINE WARMED UP FROM DRIVING, A FIRE NEARLY OCCURRED. THE CONTACT SAW SMOKE, PULLED OVER, AND OPENED THE HOOD. THE CONTACT HAD TO CALL TO HAVE MORE ANTI-FREEZE DELIVERED TO REFILL THE VEHICLE. THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO GARNET FORD (1610 WILMINGTON PIKE, WEST CHESTER, PA 19382 (610) 358-5600) WHERE IT WAS IN THE PROCESS OF BEING DIAGNOSED. THE MANUFACTURER WAS CALLED AND TRANSFERRED THE CONTACT TO NHTSA. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 122,000. "
"I WAS DRIVING DOWN THE HIGHWAY AT 70MPH AND MY WINDSHIELD CRACKED ON THE BOTTOM LEFT OR DRIVERS SIDE.  THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NO IMPACT ON THE WINDSHIELD OF ANY KIND. NO TRAFFIC AND SMOOTH HIGHWAY. TEMP WAS AROUND 30 DEGREES.  STARTED OUT AS A 5 INCH CRACK FROM THE BOTTOM UP AND HAD A VERY SMALL DIVOT.  THEN SPREAD TO A 15 INCH CRACK VERY QUICKLY.  I BROUGHT THE CAR TO THE DEALERSHIP WITH IN 24 HOURS AND THEY FILED A CLAIM WITH SUBARU. WITHIN 4 HOURS THE DEALERSHIP CALLED AND SAID CLAIM WAS DENIED. THEY SAID CRACK WAS CAUSED BY OUTSIDE FORCE DUE TO THE TINY DIVOT. THE DEALERSHIP QUOTED ME JUST UNDER $700. NOT BEING HAPPY WITH THAT I CALLED SUBARU CUSTOMER SERVICE AND THEY VERY QUICKLY THREW $500 AT ME TO HELP WITH THE REPAIR.  WHICH DOES NOT COVER THE ENTIRE COST OF THE REPAIR.  THESE WINDSHIELDS SEEM TO HAVE A RECURRING PROBLEM WITH SPONTANEOUSLY CRACKING AND SUBARU IS BRUSHING IT OFF.  THE EYESIGHT TECHNOLOGY DOES NOT WORK WITH ANY OTHER WINDSHIELD, YOU MUST BUY THE FACTORY WINDSHIELD.  I DO NOT FEEL SAFE DRIVING MY CAR WITH A SUBPAR WINDSHIELD. I'M NOT CONFIDENT THAT THE NEW WINDSHIELD THEY ARE INSTALLING WILL BE SAFE.  PLEASE HELP IN THIS VERY SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE BEING IGNORED BY SUBARU.

"WE'VE HAD OUR 2011 FORD EXPLORER FOR LESS THAN A YEAR. WE BOUGHT IT USED WITH APPROXIMATELY 130,000 MILES ON IT, IT NOW CURRENTLY HAS APPROXIMATELY 190,000 MILES. WE WERE ABOUT TO LEAVE OUR HOUSE, SO THE EXPLORER WAS STATIONARY AT THE TIME. I STARTED IT UP AND IMMEDIATELY AN ERROR POPPED UP ON THE DASH FOR ""POWER STEERING FAULT"" AND ""ADVANCETRAC"" WARNING. I ATTEMPTED TO DRIVE THE VEHICLE, BUT WITHOUT POWER STEERING I WOULD BE PUTTING MY FAMILY AND MYSELF IN DANGER. LUCKILY THIS HAPPENED WHILE THE VEHICLE WAS STATIONARY. IF MY WIFE WERE OUT DRIVING AND THIS HAPPENED, IT COULD HAVE BEEN VERY BAD FOR HER AND MY KIDS.    WE SET UP AN APPOINTMENT THE FORD DEALERSHIP IN OUR TOWN, THEY FOUND THAT THE POWER STEERING RACK NEEDED TO BE REPLACED AND TOLD US THAT IT WOULD COST ~$2100. I TOLD THEM IT SHOULD BE COVERED BECAUSE OF A RECALL I FOUND ONLINE FOR THIS PROBLEM. THEY TOLD ME TO CALL FORD CUSTOMER SERVICE. MY WIFE CALLED AND THEY TOLD HER THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO. I PROCEEDED TO CALL BACK THE FORD CUSTOMER SERVICE AND SPOKE TO A REP. AFTER GETTING THE RUN AROUND HE FINALLY GAVE ME A CASE NUMBER TO GIVE TO THE FORD DEALERSHIP, EXPRESSING THAT THIS WOULD BE FULLY COVERED UNDER A FIELD SERVICE ACTION #: 15N01 FOR EPAS STEERRING EFFORTS, WITH NO COST TO ME.     I GAVE THE CASE NUMBER TO THE FORD SERVICE REP. TODAY I GET A CALL BACK THAT THE CASE NUMBER IS DECLINED BY FORD BECAUSE OUR VEHICLE HAS OVER 150,000 MILES ON IT. WE NEVER GOT A RECALL NOTICE IN THE MAIL OR A CALL FROM FORD MENTIONING THE RECALL BEFORE THE 150,000 MILE DEADLINE. WE'VE HAD THIS VEHICLE FOR LESS THAN A YEAR AND STILL OWE $8000 ON IT, AND FORD WANTS $2100 TO REPAIR A PART THAT THEY KNEW WAS A COMMON PROBLEM."

"I OWN A 2015 F350 SUPERDUTY.

THE REMOVAL OF THIS FEATURE, EVEN THOUGH ITS STANDARD ON MOST VEHICLES SOLD IN NORTH AMERICA SHOULD HAVE BEEN DISCLOSED BEFORE THE VEHICLE WAS PURCHASED. FURTHER, THE FACT THAT NEITHER THE SALES PERSON AT THE DEALER, SERVICE DEPARTMENT PERSONNEL OR MANAGEMENT AT THE DEALER KNEW ABOUT THIS, SHOWS THAT NISSAN PURPOSELY WITHHELD THIS INFORMATION FROM THE CONSUMERS.

"HELLO,    THIS CAR WAS LEASED BACK IN OCT 2017 AS A BRAND NEW CAR FROM GARDEN CITY MAZDA (NY). SIX MONTHS AGO (JULY 2019), WE BROUGHT THE CAR TO THE SERVICE TO CHECK THE HUGE VIBRATIONS WHEN BRAKING. THEY FOUND A LEFT REAR BRAKE CALIPER WAS LEAKING AND FAILED CAUSED PLATE (ROTOR) AND PAD DAMAGE. CAR WAS ONLY DONE 5731 MILES. THEY HAVE REPLACED THE LEFT REAR ROTOR, PADS AND CALIPER. THEN RESURFACED (RR) ROTOR AND PADS.    AFTER 6 MONTHS TODAY (JAN 3RD 2020), WE HAD TO TAKE THE CAR TO THE SERVICE BECAUSE OF THE VIBRATIONS RE-OCCURRING WHEN BRAKING AS IT WAS VERY CONCERNING. CAR IS DONE 9744 MILES TO DATE. AND THIS TIME IT WAS BOTH FRONT BRAKE PLATES (ROTORS) AND PAD ARE WORN OUT.     THIS CAR IS ALMOST DAILY DRIVEN (4-5 DAYS A WEEK) AND HAVE LOW MILEAGE DUE TO THE LOW DISTANCE (+-10 MILES/DAY) IT WAS DRIVEN PER DAY. AND WE HAD TO CHANGE THE BRAKES TWICE WITHIN LESS THAN 10K MILES. MAZDA SERVICE AND MAZDA (MANUFACTURER) CLAIMS THIS IS DUE TO REGULAR WEAR AND TEAR AND CAR MUST BE SITTING THERE FOR A LONG.     WHICH I DO NOT BELIEVE IS A VALID STATEMENT FROM MAZDA AS AN EXPERIENCE CAR OWNER AND A DRIVER. I HAD OTHER CARS THAT WERE SITTING ON MY DRIVE WAY LONGER THAN THIS CAR AND NEVER HAD THIS MANY BRAKE ISSUES.     BRAKE FAILURES ARE VERY DANGEROUS AND PUT EVERYONE AT RISK. MY CONCERN IS THAT THE BRAKE COMPONENTS USED IN 2017 MAZDA CX5 IS NOT UP TO US CONSUMER SAFETY STANDARDS AND NOT SUITABLE FOR THE WEATHER CONDITIONS WHERE THE VEHICLES WERE SOLD.

"I WAS DRIVING MY TRUCK UP A 6% PERCENT GRADE WHEN THE CHANGE FUEL FILTER SOON WARNING POPPED UP, ABOUT A MINUTE LATER THE VEHICLE STARTED TO LOSE POWER, I KEPT DRIVING TO TRY AND GET OVER THE HILL SO I COULD MAKE IT TO A REPAIR SHOP TO HAVE IT CHECKED OUT. I WAS ONLY ABLE TO MAKE IT ABOUT 2 MILES AFTER THE WARNING SHOWED UP BEFORE THE VEHICLE COMPLETELY SHUT DOWN AND WOULD NOT RESTART. (THERE WAS NOT ENOUGH ROOM ON THE SHOULDER TO PULL OVER ON MY SIDE THE ROAD SO I TRIED TO TURN ACROSS THE HIGHWAY WHERE THERE WAS AN EMERGENCY PULL OUT AND AS I DID THE TRUCK DIED SIDEWAYS RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE HIGHWAY, TAKING UP SEVERAL LANES OF TRAFFIC, FORTUNATELY THERE WAS ENOUGH INCLINE THAT I WAS ABLE TO ROLL BACKWARDS AND PULL OVER UP AGAINST THE GUARDRAIL) OF COURSE I HAD NO POWER STEERING OR POWER BRAKES SINCE THE TRUCK WAS NOT RUNNING. IT WAS A VERY DANGEROUS SITUATION! I WAS ABLE TO GET MY TRUCK TOWED TO THE LOCAL GM REPAIR SHOP WHERE THEY DETERMINED THAT THE FUEL PUMP HAD A CATASTROPHIC FAILURE AND HAD SENT ALUMINUM SHAVINGS THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE FUEL SYSTEM. THEY SAID THE REPAIRS WOULD BE APPROXIMATELY $10,000 SO I CONTACTED GM AND DESCRIBED WHAT HAPPENED, AND THEY BASICALLY TOLD ME TO GO FLY A KITE. AFTER DOING SOME RESEARCH ONLINE IT LOOKS LIKE THERE HAS BEEN A MAJOR PROBLEM WITH GM TRUCKS WITH THE DURAMAX MOTOR FROM 2011-2016 AFTER THEY CHANGED THERE FUEL PUMP FROM THE CP3 HIGH VOLUME LOW PRESSURE PUMP TO THE CP4 HIGH PRESSURE LOW VOLUME PUMP. WHICH MEANS THE PUMP RUNS WITH LESS LUBRICATION WHICH RESULTS IN PUMP FAILURE, AND NOT JUST FAILURE BUT CATASTROPHIC FAILURE WHICH CAUSES MAJOR DAMAGE TO THE ENTIRE FUEL SYSTEM.  I HAVE BEEN A LOYAL GM OWNER FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS, AND I AM EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED THAT GM IS NOT WILLING TO MAKE IT RIGHT."
"BMW IS AWARE OF A CRACK DEVELOPING IN A FRONT SUSPENSION CARRIER (ONE EACH LOCATED ON BOTH THE DRIVER'S SIDE AND PASSENGER'S SIDE - TWO TOTAL). BMW HAD TO REPLACE MY PASSENGER SIDE CARRIER UNDER WARRANTY. WHEN I TOOK MY CAR IN FOR AN OIL CHANGE, THE SERVICE TECHNICIAN DETECTED A HAIRLINE CRACK AND ORDERED THE REPLACEMENT PART FROM GERMANY. I DID NOT ASK FOR THE PART TO BE INSPECTED; IT SEEMS THAT BMW HAS INSTRUCTED ITS SERVICE CENTERS TO INSPECT VEHICLES FOR THIS PARTICULAR FAILURE. I ASKED THE SERVICE CENTER TO PROACTIVELY REPLACE THE DRIVER'S SIDE CARRIER, TOO. THEY REFUSED TO DO SO. THE ISSUE WITH CRACKS DEVELOPING IN THE FRONT TWO CARRIERS IS WELL DOCUMENTED (SEE, FOR EXAMPLE:  HTTPS://F80.BIMMERPOST.COM/FORUMS/SHOWTHREAD.PHP?T=1550724). I HAVE ATTACHED A COPY OF THE SERVICE RECORD SHOWING REPLACEMENT OF MY PASSENGER SIDE CARRIER. I HAVE ALSO ATTACHED TWO IMAGES SHOWING CRACKS ON THE PART FROM THE LINK PROVIDED ABOVE. I BELIEVE THAT BMW SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO REPLACE THE CARRIERS ON ALL CARS GIVEN THE POSSIBILITY OF FAILURE AND THE KNOWN FAILURE FREQUENCY."
"AT 97000 MILES, FOLLOWING ALL SERVICE AND OIL CHANGES, ENGINE BLEW OUT. IT SHEARED OFF HEAD BOLTS, BROKE THE TIMING CHAIN, LARGE AMOUNTS OF METAL BOTH BEFORE AND AFTER THE OIL FILTER. I HAVE TALKED TO MANY MECHANICS, AS WELL HAVE TALKED TO NUMEROUS PEOPLE THAT OWN THESE VEHICLES. THEY ALL SAY THE SAME THING. THERE IS SOMETHING GOING ON WITH THE BUILD OF THESE ENGINES THAT IS CAUSING FAILURE. CAR WAS STATIONARY AFTER A 45 MINUTE DRIVE. THE NEXT DAY THERE WAS NO RESPONSE FROM TURNING THE KEY. CHEVY HAS BEEN GETTING AWAY WITH THESE TYPE OF ENGINE PROBLEMS FOR YEARS AND I BELIEVE SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE IN THEIR QUALITY CONTROL DEPARTMENT.  THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO REASON THIS SHOULD HAPPEN WITH SUCH LOW MILES, LET ALONE ALL THE OTHER PEOPLE WITH THE SAME PROBLE.S."

"WHEN DRIVING AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS, THERE IS ALMOST LIKE A ""DEAD SPOT"" IN THE STEERING.  MAKING SMALL WHEEL ADJUSTMENTS WITHIN YOUR OWN LANE, IT ALMOST FEELS AS IF YOUR TIRES BREAK LOOSE, BUT ON DRY PAVEMENT.  WHEN THE STEERING THEN CATCHES, IT CAN CAUSE A SMALL JERK.

"MY HUSBAND WAS DRIVING HOME FROM WORK ON A CITY STREET WHEN THE CAR GAVE AN ALERT: 'DRIVETRAIN MALFUNCTION'DRIVE MODERATELY.' THEN MY HUSBAND GOT ANOTHER ALERT: 'OIL PRESSURE LOW' WHICH WARNED NOT TO DRIVE. FORTUNATELY, BY THAT POINT HE WAS ON OUR BLOCK SO HE MOVED THE CAR VERY SLOWLY TOWARDS OUR HOUSE. THE CAR SHUT DOWN, BUT HE WAS ABLE TO COAST TO PARK THE CAR STREETSIDE.     WE HAD THE CAR TOWED TO THE DEALERSHIP THE NEXT DAY AND LEARNED THAT THE TIMING CHAIN HAD MALFUNCTIONED AND THE CAR WAS INOPERABLE UNTIL THE PROBLEM WAS FIXED. JUST THE DAY BEFORE THIS VEHICLE FAILURE, WE WERE COMING HOME FROM SEEING FAMILY FOR THE HOLIDAYS. IF THIS HAD HAPPENED ON THE HIGHWAY OR ANY OTHER BUSY ROAD, WE COULD HAVE BEEN IN SERIOUS DANGER. THERE WAS VERY LITTLE TIME TO GET TO A SAFE PLACE BECAUSE THE CAR SHUT DOWN SO QUICKLY. I'M GRATEFUL THAT MY HUSBAND WAS SO CLOSE TO HOME WHEN THIS HAPPENED. AS IT IS, WE'LL BE INCURRING CONSIDERABLE EXPENSE TO REPAIR A CAR THAT BMW SEEMS TO KNOW HAS A MAJOR DEFECT.     THE CAR IS A 2013 BMW X3 WITH AN N20 ENGINE; IT HAS ABOUT 107,000 MILES ON IT. THAT'S A LOT OF MILES, BUT NOT NEARLY SO MANY THAT SUCH A MAJOR VEHICLE MALFUNCTION COULD REASONABLY BE EXPECTED. THERE IS NO REASON THAT THE TIMING CHAIN SHOULD FAIL ON A CAR THAT WE HAVE MAINTAINED AND CARED FOR. THIS IS THE KIND OF PROBLEM YOU MIGHT REASONABLY EXPECT AROUND 150,000 MILES, BUT WE'RE NOT AT THAT POINT.    I'VE SINCE LEARNED THROUGH SOME RESEARCH THAT MANY BMWS WITH N20 ENGINES MADE IN 2010-2015 HAVE HAD THESE TIMING CHAIN ISSUES AND THAT IT IS WELL KNOWN TO MANY OWNERS AND TO BMW ITSELF.

"MY HUSBAND WAS DRIVING HOME FROM WORK ON A CITY STREET WHEN THE CAR GAVE AN ALERT: 'DRIVETRAIN MALFUNCTION'DRIVE MODERATELY.' THEN MY HUSBAND GOT ANOTHER ALERT: 'OIL PRESSURE LOW' WHICH WARNED NOT TO DRIVE. FORTUNATELY, BY THAT POINT HE WAS ON OUR BLOCK SO HE MOVED THE CAR VERY SLOWLY TOWARDS OUR HOUSE. THE CAR SHUT DOWN, BUT HE WAS ABLE TO COAST TO PARK THE CAR STREETSIDE.     WE HAD THE CAR TOWED TO THE DEALERSHIP THE NEXT DAY AND LEARNED THAT THE TIMING CHAIN HAD MALFUNCTIONED AND THE CAR WAS INOPERABLE UNTIL THE PROBLEM WAS FIXED. JUST THE DAY BEFORE THIS VEHICLE FAILURE, WE WERE COMING HOME FROM SEEING FAMILY FOR THE HOLIDAYS. IF THIS HAD HAPPENED ON THE HIGHWAY OR ANY OTHER BUSY ROAD, WE COULD HAVE BEEN IN SERIOUS DANGER. THERE WAS VERY LITTLE TIME TO GET TO A SAFE PLACE BECAUSE THE CAR SHUT DOWN SO QUICKLY. I'M GRATEFUL THAT MY HUSBAND WAS SO CLOSE TO HOME WHEN THIS HAPPENED. AS IT IS, WE'LL BE INCURRING CONSIDERABLE EXPENSE TO REPAIR A CAR THAT BMW SEEMS TO KNOW HAS A MAJOR DEFECT.     THE CAR IS A 2013 BMW X3 WITH AN N20 ENGINE; IT HAS ABOUT 107,000 MILES ON IT. THAT'S A LOT OF MILES, BUT NOT NEARLY SO MANY THAT SUCH A MAJOR VEHICLE MALFUNCTION COULD REASONABLY BE EXPECTED. THERE IS NO REASON THAT THE TIMING CHAIN SHOULD FAIL ON A CAR THAT WE HAVE MAINTAINED AND CARED FOR. THIS IS THE KIND OF PROBLEM YOU MIGHT REASONABLY EXPECT AROUND 150,000 MILES, BUT WE'RE NOT AT THAT POINT.

INTERIOR REARVIEW MIRROR DEVELOPED BLACK MARKINGS THROUGHOUT MIRROR MAKING IT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO VISUALIZE REARVIEW TRAFFIC.  THE RESPONSE FROM LEXUS IS THAT THE GLASS ITSELF OR THE MATERIALS BEHIND THE GLASS ARE BREAKING DOWN RESULTING IN THE FUNCTIONAL LOSS OF THE REARVIEW MIRROR WHICH NOW HAS BECOME DANGEROUS FOR DRIVING. HAS BEEN PROGRESSIVELY GETTING WORSE OVER PAST SEVERAL YEARS.  LEXUS IS AWARE OF THIS DEFECT AND OCCURS IN A NUMBER OF THEIR OLDER MODELS BUT IS NOT ACCEPTING RESPONSIBILITY FOR REPAIRING OR REPLACING MIRROR WHICH COSTS THE CONSUMER ALMOST $2000 FOR A NEW REPLACEMENT WHICH IS FINANCIALLY UNOBTAINABLE FOR MANY OWNERS.

THE TRUCK STARTS SHIMMYING SO SEVERELY THAT I IMMEDIATELY HAVE TO COME TO A STOP TO GET THE SHIMMYING TO STOP. ONCE I STOP AND START GOING AGAIN EVERYTHING SEEMS TO BE OK. THIS HAS HAPPENED TWICE AND BOTH TIMES HAS NEARLY CAUSED AN ACCIDENT. I KNOW IF MY WIFE WOULD HAVE BEEN DRIVING SHE WOULD HAVE HAD AN ACCIDENT. I HAVE TAKEN IT TO THE DEALER AND WAITED TWO MONTHS WITH A PART SUPPOSEDLY ORDERED AND IT HAD NOT COME IN. I THEN WENT BACK AND SAID THEY NEEDED TO MAKE THIS AN EMERGENCY ORDER. THEY DID AND IT HAS BEEN THREE WEEKS AND NO PART. I'M THINKING FORD HAS NO FIX FOR THIS AND THIS IS A VERY DANGEROUS PROBLEM. I PAID 60K FOR THIS VEHICLE AND ADDED ANOTHER 5800.00 FOR EXTENDED WARRANTY AND MAINTENANCE CONTRACT ALL TO HAVE A VEHICLE I AM AFRAID MAY GO INTO THIS SHIMMY AT ANY TIME WHEN DRIVING DOWN THE ROAD. I NEED YOUR HELP TO MAKE FORD AWARE THEY NEED TO FIX THIS PROBLEM. I'M FINE WITH THE TRUCK OTHERWISE BUT I NEED THIS FIXED. THIS TRUCK IS SUPPOSE TO GET ME THROUGH RETIREMENT. I DON'T HAVE THIS KIND OF MONEY TO SPEND ON REPLACING IT AS I WOULD LOSE TONS OF MONEY IF I HAD TO TRADE IT IN ALREADY. THE TRUCK HAS 9K MILES. PLEASE HELP. THANK YOU.

"BONDED INTRUSION BAR SEPARATED FROM DOOR SKIN. SEPARATION CAUSES RUBBING/CHAFFING/NOISE WHEN DOOR IS OPERATED AND WAS WHAT ALERTED ME TO THE PRESENCE OF THE ISSUE.

FCA HAS CLEARLY NOT CORRECTED THIS DESIGN ISSUE, AND I AM CONCERNED THAT IT LEADS TO A WEAKENED STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY/SAFETY FEATURE OF THE VEHICLE. I AM ALSO CONCERNED THAT BECAUSE THE FIX INCLUDES REPAINTING PART OF A BRAND NEW VEHICLE, MANY PEOPLE WILL NOT WANT TO HAVE THEIR VEHICLES REPAIRED. ALSO, DEPENDING ON PERSONALITY, IT MAY BE VERY EASY TO OVERLOOK THE NOISE THAT CALLED MY ATTENTION TO THE ISSUE IN THE FIRST PLACE. BONDING LIKE THIS IS USED EXTENSIVELY IN MODERN VEHICLES. IF THEY HAVE A PROBLEM WITH IT IN THIS LOCATION, DO THEY HAVE A PROBLEM WITH IT IN OTHER LOCATIONS OR VEHICLES THAT AREN'T BEING ADDRESSED. CLEARLY THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT THIS IS A CONTINUED ISSUE ACROSS MODEL YEARS, NOT AN ISOLATED INCIDENT."

"WINDSHIELD WIPER CONTINUE TO OPERATE IN LOW INTERMITTENT WHEN THE SWITCH IS IN THE OFF POSITION - THE DRIVER CANNOT TURN OFF THE WIPERS.  ANY TIME THE TRUCK'S ENGINE IS ON, THE WIPERS RUN.    FORD MOTOR COMPANY PUBLISHED ONLINE TSB 15-0061 ON APRIL 27, 2015, WHICH ADDRESSED THE PROBLEM FOR MODEL YEARS 2011-2014 FOR EXPLORERS, F150'S, EDGES, MKX'S AND F-SUPER DUTY VEHICLES.  THE BULLETIN CALL FOR THE INSTALLATION OF A ""NEW WIPER/MALFUNCTION SWITCH, WHICH AT MY DEALER COSTS $900.    OBVIOUSLY, A VEHICLE CANNOT BE SAFELY OPERATED WITH THE WIPER RUNNING IN DRY WEATHER.  EVENTUALLY, THE WIPER BLADES WOULD MELT AND STREAK THE WINDSHIELD, THUS BLURRING THE DRIVER'S VISION.  REPAIRING THE PROBLEM IS NOT IS NOT OPTIONAL, IT MUS BE DONE.    FORD KNEW IT HAD PROBLEMS WITH THE EQUIPMENT IN MODEL YEARS 2011-2014.  I HAVE A 2015 AND THE PROBLEM STILL EXISTS.  NOT ONLY HAVE THEY NOT SOLVED THE PROBLEM INN NEWER MODELS, THEY FAILED TO RE-ENGINEER THE WIPER SYSTEM TO MAKE THE REPAIR LESS COSTLY.    REPLACING THE SWITCH REQUIRES DISASSEMBLING AND REASSEMBLING THE STEERING COLUMN, WHICH IS LABOR INTENSIVE AND THUS EXPENSIVE.    FORD HAS MANAGED TO LIMIT ITS EXPOSURE BY CALLING THE PROBLEM A WARRANTY ISSUE.  I COMMUTE 80 MILES A DAY IN METRO ATLANTA.  THE WEATHER HAS BEEN RELATIVELY DRY IN RECENT YEARS, SO I BLEW THROUGH THE MILEAGE LIMITS ON THE WARRANTY WITH LITTLE NEED TO USE MY WIPERS.      WORKING WIPERS ARE NECESSARY SAFETY EQUIPMENT.  FORD KNEW THEY HAD A PROBLEM FOR SEVERAL YEARS, BUT DID NOT SOLVE THE ISSUE.  THE COST IS NOT AFFORDABLE FOR MANY AMERICANS.  FORD SHOULD BARE THE BURDEN OF REPAIRING EQUIPMENT THAT THEY KNEW WAS FAULTY, BUT CONTINUED TO INSTALL IN NEW VEHICLES."

"THE CAR IS CURRENTLY REGISTERING INDIVIDUAL CYLINDER AND MULTIPLE RANDOM CYLINDER MISFIRES.  WHEN STARTING- THE ENGINE WILL VIBRATE EXCESSIVELY FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME THEN WILL EVEN OUT AND RUN NORMALLY.  AT IDLE, THE ENGINE WILL EXPERIENCE MILDLY EXCESSIVE VIBRATION.  I HAVE TAKEN THE CAR TO SEVERAL REPAIR SHOPS AND HAVE REPLACED COILS AND SPARK PLUGS.  ONE REPAIR SHOP MENTIONED A VALVE TIMING CONTROL CODE ON THEIR DIAGNOSTIC EQUIPMENT.  I TOOK THE CAR TO AN OFFICIAL DEALER FOR THE MANUFACTURER AND THEY DID NOT IDENTIFY THIS CODE. THE DEALER INDICATED THAT A VALVE ADJUSTMENT WAS NEEDED.  I THEN RETRIEVED THE CAR AND HAD AN ALTERNATE DEALER FOR THE MANUFACTURER DIAGNOSE THE ISSUE.  THIS SECOND DEALER SERVICE DEPARTMENT ALSO INDICATED THAT A VALVE ADJUSTMENT WAS NEEDED. THE VALVE ADJUSTMENT REPAIR WAS PERFORMED.  THE CAR DROVE NORMALLY FOR A FEW DAYS THEN BEGAN REAND AN GULAR MODERATE TO HEAVY VIBRATION, THE 'CHECK ENGINE' LIGHT FLASHED ON AND OFF THEN EVENTUALLY STAYED ON CONTINUOUSLY. THE CAR WAS RETURNED TO THE DEALER WHO HAD DONE THE VALVE ADJUSTMENT AND THE DEALER INDICATED THAT THE CAR ENGINE NEEDS TO BE REPLACED OR THAT BOTH HEAD GASKETS NEED TO BE REPLACED. I FOUND THAT THERE WAS A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT FILED AGAINST THIS MANUFACTURER RELATED TO VALVE TIMING CONTROL PROBLEMS LEADING TO CYLINDER MISFIRES AND ENGINE FAILURE WITH AN EXTENDED WARRANTY OFFERED AS A RESULT.

THE STEERING WHEEL ROTATES BACK AND FORTH RAPIDLY AND THE WHOLE TRUCK SHAKES DRAMATICALLY.  WHEN SLOWING DOWN TO ABOUT 20-30 MPH, IT STOPS.  SPEED BACK UP AGAIN AND IT STARTS AGAIN. IT IS VERY DANGEROUS.  I HAVE TALKED TO THE DEALER MULTIPLE TIMES.  THEY HAVE NO PARTS TO FIX IT.  SUPPOSEDLY IT IS THE STEERING STABILIZER THAT IS FAILING.  I HAVE A CASE WITH FORD CUSTOMER CARE WHO HAVE ALSO BEEN COMMUNICATING WITH THE DEALER I BOUGHT IT AT.  NO RESOLUTIONS AS OF YET.  IT CONTINUALLY DEATH WOBBLES TODAY.

THIS IS CLEARLY A SAFETY ISSUE.  IT DID NOT SEEM THIS WAY ON THE TEST DRIVE. THE OVERALL POWER HAS GONE DOWN THE PAST FEW WEEKS. TRYING TO PASS SOMEONE - HAH, MAKE SURE YOU HAVE PLENTY OF ROOM, BECAUSE THAT TURBO LAG WILL  BITE YOU IN THE BUTT WHEN YOU PULL OUT AND SUDDENLY YOU ARE STUCK IN THE ONCOMING LANE WAITING FOR THE ENGINE TO KICK IN.   AFTER AN INSPECTION BY THE DEALER - THEY SAID "" NOTHING IS WRONG, IT IS PERFORMING EXACTLY AS DESIGNED AND WITH SPECS"".  REALLY SCARY WHEN THE DEALER SERVICE WRITER TELLS YOU - ""IT IS PERFORMING AS DESIGNED"".   I TAKE THAT TO MEAN THEY ARE FULLY AWARE OF THIS SAFETY DESIGN FLAW/DEFECT.    THE DEALER THEN SAID - JUST DRIVE IT IN THE ""SPORT"" MODE AND IT WILL NOT BE AS BAD. THAT IS LUDICROUS. THE DEFAULT MODE IS ""COMFORT"" AND THAT IS WHERE THE BEST RIDE AND PERFORMANCE, MILEAGE, ETC. IS TO BE ACHIEVED.    I TOOK A TEST DRIVE WITH THE DEALER'S MECHANIC. HE ADVISED THAT HE GETS THIS COMPLAINT EVERY SINGLE DAY. IT IS A SAFETY DESIGN DEFECT INHERENT IN THE ENGINE.  HE CHECKED FOR ANY ERROR CODES OR SOFTWARE UPDATES - NONE ARE PRESENT OR AVAILABLE.  THE MECHANIC VERBALLY CONFIRMED THAT THE ""ENGINE LAG"" IS CLEARLY THERE.  HOWEVER, WHEN THE SERVICE WRITER COMPLETED THE TICKET, HE WROTE THAT THE MECHANIC SAID HE COULD NOT DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM.  THAT IS AN ABSOLUTE UN-TRUTH.

WHEN A WHEEL CONTACTS THE INSIDE OF THE WELL AND LOCKS UP IT WILL CAUSE THE WHEEL ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE TO INSTANTLY DOUBLE ITS ROTATION SPEED DUE TO THE WAY IN WHICH THE CARS DIFFERENTIAL OPERATES.

"MY BUICK LACROSSE WAS HANDLING JUST FINE UNTIL I PUT A HEAVY PIECE OF LUGGAGE INTO THE TRUNK. I GOT BACK IN THE CAR AND IT WOULDN'T START. A MESSAGE WAS ON MY DASHBOARD SAYING THERE WAS A POWER STEERING PROBLEM. I WAS AT THE AIRPORT, SO A TOW TRUCK DRIVER WAS ON THE SCENE WITHIN MINUTES. THE TOW TRUCK DRIVER JUMPED MY CAR. HE HANDED ME THE TRIM COVER THAT COVERS THE BATTERY. I'M NOT SURE IF HE TOOK IT OFF, OR WHETHER IT CAME OFF WHEN I PUT THE HEAVY SUITCASE IN THE TRUNK. I PUT THE TRIM COVER IN THE BACK OF MY CAR AND DROVE OFF. THE CAR THEN STALLED WHEN I PUT IT IN REVERSE TO BACK INTO THE DRIVEWAY. IT WOULDN'T START AGAIN, SO I JUMPED IT. IT WORKED AND I DROVE TO MY MECHANIC. MECHANIC SAID MY BATTERY WAS FINE. THEY CHECKED THE ERROR MESSAGES. THEY COULDN'T FIGURE OUT WHAT WAS WRONG SO THEY SENT ME TO A DEALER. THE DEALER  COULDN'T FIGURE OUT WHAT WAS WRONG AND SAID TO COME BACK IF IT HAPPENS AGAIN.       FOR ABOUT TWO MONTHS THE CAR WOULD RANDOMLY NOT START OR STALL. SEVERAL DAYS COULD GO BY WITH IT WORKING JUST FINE.    AT FIRST, WHEN IT STALLED IT WAS ONLY WHEN I HAD JUST STARTED THE CAR OR PUT IT IN REVERSE. BUT THEN THE VEHICLE STALLED WHILE I WAS DRIVING ON THE INTERSTATE, AT THE TOP OF A LONG HILL, IN A CONSTRUCTION ZONE. I WAS ABLE TO COAST DOWN A HALF MILE OR SO UNTIL I ARRIVED AT AN EMERGENCY PULL OFF ZONE. THE POWER STEERING WENT OUT SO THE STEERING WHEEL WAS TIGHT BUT WORKABLE. AFTER PULLING OVER, I TRIED STARTING THE CAR AGAIN BUT IT DIDN'T WORK. I HAD A SELF JUMP START KIT, AND WAS ABLE TO JUMP THE CAR AGAIN. IT STARTED BACK UP AND SEEMED LIKE NOTHING WAS WRONG. BUT ABOUT FIVE MINUTES LATER IT STALLED AGAIN. FORTUNATELY, I WAS BY ANOTHER EMERGENCY PULL OFF.   AT THIS POINT, I PUT THE TRIM COVER BACK ON THE BATTERY. AND THE CAR HAS WORKED FINE FOR SEVERAL MONTHS.   THE CAR SHOULD NOT START AND THEN RANDOMLY STALL IF THE TRIM COVER IS OFF."

I WAS DRIVING IN WET WEATHER AND SLID ON SOME LEAVES WHILE BRAKING.  THIS CAUSED AN ACTIVATION OF THE ANTI LOCK BRAKING SYSTEM (ABS).  AFTER THE ABS EVENT I HAD A DIFFICULT TIME STOPPING THE CAR.  THE BRAKE PEDAL FELT SPONGY AND IT TOOK ALL OF MY EFFORT ON THE BRAKE PEDAL TO BRING THE CAR TO A STOP.  THIS SPONGY BRAKES PERSISTED FOR SEVERAL MILES.  I IMMEDIATELY TOOK MY CAR TO MY NEIGHBORHOOD MECHANIC.  HE CHECKED THE BRAKE SYSTEM AND COULD FIND NOTHING WRONG.  THE BRAKE SYSTEM HAD RETURNED TO NORMAL BY ITSELF.

INTENSITY OF OSCILLATION QUICKLY INCREASED TO THE POINT I COULD BARELY MAINTAIN CONTROL OF TRUCK.  SPEEDING UP AND SLOWING DOWN (RELEASING THROTTLE DID NOT DAMPED THE OSCILLATION).

"AT 59000 MILES MY 2010 LEXUS EXPERIENCED ROUGH SHIFTING UP THROUGH THE GEARS AND DOWN THE GEARS UNTIL THE CAR COMES TO A FULL STOP. I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO THE LEXUS DEALER NEAR ME IN FLORIDA. THEY DIAGNOSED THE ROUGH SHIFTING AS A BAD TRANSMISSION THAT NEEDED TO BE REPLACED.   ALTHOUGH THE POWERTRAIN HAS A 7 YEAR 70,000 MILE WARRANTY FOR DEFECTS, THE FACTORY CUSTOMER SATISFACTION REPRESENTATIVE ONLY OFFERED TO OFFSET THE $7,000 COST OF TRANSMISSION REPLACEMENT BY $3,000. I DO NOT THINK THAT I SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY PORTION OF THE COST ASSOCIATED WITH THE PREMATURE FAILURE OF THE TRANSMISSION. ALTHOUGH THE VEHICLE IS 10 MODEL YEARS OLD IT HAS BEEN CAREFULLY DRIVEN LESS THAN 60,000 MILES. MOST OF THE MILES ARE HIGHWAY MILES AS THIS IS OUR SECOND CAR AND IS USED PRIMARILY FOR DRIVING TRIPS. IT IS GARAGED DURING INCLEMENT WEATHER. HAS BEEN SERVICED ONLY BY A LEXUS DEALER SINCE NEW.   IT IS MY CONCERN THAT LEXUS HAS PROVIDED ME WITH A DEFECTIVE PRODUCT THAT FAILED AFTER 59,000 MILES THROUGH NO FAULT ON MY BEHALF. BECAUSE THE CAR EXCEEDED THE YEARS OF THE WARRANTY SITTING IN A GARAGE NOT BEING USED SHOULD NOT BE THE DECIDING FACTOR.   I REQUEST YOUR ASSISTANCE TO HAVE LEXUS  CORRECT A DEFECTIVE TRANSMISSION THAT HAS NOT BEEN USED FOR THE 70,000 MILES THAT SHOULD BE THE CONTROLLING FACTOR NOT THE AMOUNT OF TIME THE VEHICLE WAS ONLY LIGHTLY USED AND CAREFULLY MAINTAINED"

"MY RADIO STARTED ACTING STRANGELY ABOUT 3 MONTHS AGO. WHEN THE RADIO WAS ON THERE WAS IRREGULAR SQUEALING COMING FROM IT. WHEN IT FIRST STARTED, THE SQUEALING WAS ONLY WHEN THE RADIO WAS ON AND I WAS DRIVING THE CAR. LATER, THE SQUEALING ALSO STARTED TO INCLUDE LOUD POPPING NOISES, VERY MUCH LIKE AN OLD STEREO SPEAKER LOSING ITS WIRE CONNECTION. THE LOUD POPPING WAS VERY INCONSISTENT . IT THEN STARTED HAPPENING EVERY TIME I WAS IN THE CAR. IT DIDN'T MATTER IF THE RADIO WAS ON OR NOT. I EVEN  TRIED TURNING DOWN THE VOLUME, WHILE THE RADIO WAS OFF. THE POPPING NOISE WAS EXTREMELY LOUD AND DISTRACTING WHILE TRYING TO DRIVE THE VEHICLE . MANY TIME BECAUSE THE POP WAS SO LOUD I WOULD JERK THE STEERING WHEEL IN ONE DIRECTION OR ANOTHER. PASSENGERS THAT RODE IN MY CAR DURING SOME OF THE INCIDENCES HAD COMMENTED ON IT HURTING THEIR EARS AND MAKING THEM JUMP OR JERK IN THEIR SEAT. THEN, ONE DAY THE POPPING WAS HAPPENING ALMOST CONTINUOUSLY AND THEN JUST STOPPED. NOW LEAVING ME WITHOUT A RADIO AND PHONE CONNECTION. I SEARCHED THE INTERNET TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT THE PROBLEM AND HAVE FOUND THAT THIS IS AN EXTREMELY COMMON DEFECT IN THE FORD FIESTA. THE ERRATIC LOUD POPPING IS A VERY DANGEROUS DISTRACTION WHILE YOU ARE DRIVING AND I FEEL IT IS VERY MUCH A SAFETY HAZARD."

"VEHICLE FREQUENTLY EXHIBITS LOSS OF BRAKING POWER.  WHEN THIS OCCURS, SOMETHING SOUNDING LIKE THE ABS SYSTEMS IS SOMETIMES ENGAGED BY THE VEHICLE AND OTHER TIMES NOT.  WHILE GM CLAIMS BRAKING PERFORMANCE MEETS FEDERAL STANDARDS, THE BRAKING POWER IS GREATLY REDUCED WHEN THE HYDRAULIC SYSTEM IS ENGAGED AND ALMOST NON-EXISTENT WHEN NEITHER VACUUM PUMP NOR THE HYDRAULIC SYSTEM FUNCTIONS.  EVEN IF THE BRAKING PERFORMANCE MEETS FEDERAL STANDARDS, IT CREATES A DANGEROUS SITUATION WHEN THE DRIVER IS NOT EXPECTING A FAILURE.  A GMC DEALERSHIP HAS ADMITTED THERE IS AN ISSUE AND RECOMMENDS REPLACING THE VACUUM PUMP BUT HAS BEEN UNABLE TO SOURCE THE PARTS IN OVER TWO WEEKS AND HAS NO ETA FOR WHEN THE PART WILL BE AVAILABLE.  MEANWHILE THE BRAKING POWER LOSS CONDITION OCCURS EVERY TIME THE VEHICLE IS DRIVEN.  DURING THE FIRST INSTANCE, I WAS TOWING A TRAVEL TRAILER IN STOP AND GO TRAFFIC DOWN A 7% GRADE.  HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE TRAILER BRAKES, THIS COULD HAVE BEEN CATASTROPHIC.  THE SECOND OCCURRENCE INVOLVED BACKING INTO MY DRIVEWAY AND NEARLY CAUSING A COLLISION BECAUSE OF POOR BRAKING PERFORMANCE.  NOW THAT I FULLY AWARE OF THE ISSUE, THE VEHICLE IS DRIVEN SPARINGLY (ONLY WHEN ABSOLUTELY NEEDED) AND WITH GREAT CARE.  THE CHARACTERIZATION OF THIS ISSUE BY GM AS NOT BEING A GRAVE SAFETY CONCERN IS INACCURATE.  THEIR INABILITY TO SOURCE PARTS IN A TIMELY MANNER IS INEXCUSABLE."

TWICE WITHIN TWO MONTHS MY VEHICLE THAT I AM CURRENTLY LEASING HAS STALLED AND NOT ACCELERATED AFTER BEING STOPPED AT A STOP LIGHT.

I AM THANKFUL THAT A CAR WAS NOT TAILING BEHIND ME AND THAT I WAS NOT DRIVING DURING COMMUTE HOURS. TRACTION ASSIST, HILL ASSIST, AND CHECK ENGINE AT OIL TEMP LIGHT CAME ON. AT 97,000 MILES ON THE ODOMETER, THE DEALERSHIP SAID IT WAS TRANSMISSION FAILURE. PARTS IN THE TRANSMISSION WERE REPLACED; HOWEVER, DUE TO THE NATURE OF THE FAILURE AND THE POTENTIAL FOR BODILY HARM AND HARM TO PROPERTY, THESE TRANSMISSIONS SHOULD BE RECALLED AND REPLACED AS A UNIT. FOR A CAR THAT HAS HAD REGULAR MAINTENANCE AND THAT HAS NOT DRIVEN IN SEVERE CONDITIONS, IT WAS SURPRISING THAT A TRANSMISSION FAILURE SHOULD OCCUR AT THIS MILEAGE. WHILE THE EXTENDED WARRANTY FROM SUBARU SHOWS GOOD FAITH, IT DOES VERY LITTLE TO PROTECT THE SAFETY OF SUBARU DRIVERS. IT IS RECKLESS AND ABHORRENT FOR SUBARU TO BE AWARE OF THE SAFETY PROBLEM AND TO DO NOTHING TO MITIGATE IT."
"BOTH OF MY TAILLIGHTS WENT COMPLETELY OUT ON MY 2015 YUKON DENALI. I WAS TOLD BY A STRANGER WHO ASKED ME TO PULL OVER THAT BOTH LIGHTS WERE COMPLETELY OUT (SPECIFICALLY INSIDE OUR RESIDENTIAL COMMUNITY). I HAVE A FOUR YEAR OLD AND A BABY WITH MY HANDS FULL. I WAS SO GRATEFUL TO THE STRANGER THAT INFORMED ME- PREVENTING A POTENTIAL ACCIDENT WITH MY BABIES IN THE CAR. I CALLED TO SEE HOW MUCH THE REPLACEMENT LIGHTS WOULD BE. WITH LABOR WE WERE LOOKING AT $2,000 AT THE DEALERSHIP! TO ME THIS WAS OUTRAGEOUS... ESPECIALLY AFTER DOING RESEARCH AND SEEING THAT MANY 2015 YUKON DENALI OWNERS HAVE THE SAME ISSUE AND THIS IS NOT YET A RECALL FOR GMC! WHEN WILL THE ISSUE BE RECALLED?... HEAVEN FORBID NOT AFTER A HORRIFIC ACCIDENT FROM A BLATANT SAFETY ISSUE THAT THEY ARE NOT TAKING SERIOUSLY! WE PROCEEDED TO CALL GMC COMPLAINT DEPARTMENT TO FILE A COMPLAINT- THE WOMAN  LIED AND TOLD ME SHE HAD NEVER HEARD OF THIS BEING AN ISSUE BUT EVEN IF SHE HAD SHE COULDN'T TELL ME.... NEEDLESS TO SAY MY COMPLAINT WENT UPON DEAF EARS AT GMC. I HAD NO OTHER CHOICE BUT TO ORDER TWO NEW TAILLIGHTS THROUGH GMC.... NOW THAT I AM AWAITING MY ORDER I'M THINKING THAT I COULD EXPERIENCE THE SAME ISSUE WITH MY NEW LIGHTS. ADDING TO MY FRUSTRATION, THE PARTS DEPARTMENT SOLIDIFIED THAT THE TAILLIGHT ISSUE IS INCESSANT WITH THIS MAKE, MODEL AND YEAR... AND THEY NEED TO KEEP MY TAILLIGHTS WHEN THEY ISSUE MY NEW LIGHTS. I COULDN'T HELP BUT FIND THIS STRANGE AND BECAME SKEPTICAL THAT THEY NEED TO KEEP MY FAULTY TAILLIGHTS. I'M FRUSTRATED  AND NERVOUS DRIVING MY VEHICLE WITH MY CHILDREN. I'M WORRIED FOR OUR SAFETY AND I PRAY MY COMPLAINT IS TAKEN SERIOUSLY. GMC NEEDS TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR FAULTY PRODUCTS.

THE CAR IS UNSAFE TO DRIVE AT NIGHT AND THE CAR HAS BEEN PARKED FOR THE LAST FOUR WEEKS. IT'S OBVIOUSLY AN ENGINEERING FLAW THE CONSUMER SHOULD NOT PAY FOR. YOU CAN'T VALUE ENGINEER SAFETY.  I CONTACTED NISSAN TO SEE IF THEY WILL DO THE RIGHT THING AND REPLACE THE HEADLIGHT ASSEMBLIES. IN CLOSING THE TURN SIGNAL BULBS PRODUCE MORE LIGHT THAN THE LOW BEAM HEADLIGHTS.
"REVERSE CAMERA CUTS IN AND OUT WHEN BACKING UP, LINES IN SCREEN WITH A MESSAGE SAYING SERVICE REVERSE CAMERA. WENT TO DEALER AND THEY HAVE NO FIX FOR IT, THIS IS A SAFETY CONCERN AS IT IS A CAMERA FOR ASSISTING LONG FOR A DRIVING PURPOSE."

"TRANSMISSION INTERMITTENTLY JERKS VIOLENTLY WHEN ACCELERATING FROM AROUND 10-20 MPH. THIS HAPPENS MOST OFTEN WHEN WE SLOW DOWN TO MAKE A TURN AND ARE NOT COMING TO A FULL STOP. SO WHEN WE BEGIN TO ACCELERATE AFTER THE TURN, THE VAN LOSES ALL FORWARD MOMENTUM AND FEELS LIKE IT'S IN NEUTRAL FOR ABOUT 2 SECONDS AND THEN SUDDENLY LUNGES FORWARD THROWING OUR HEADS BACK INTO THE HEADREST PRETTY HARD. WE'VE BEEN EXTREMELY CLOSE TO BEING REAR ENDED TWICE THE PAST MONTH. THIS TRANSMISSION ISSUE HAS HAPPENED ROUGHLY 25 TIMES SINCE WE BOUGHT THE VAN IN OCT. 2019."

'THE BRAKE FLUID IS LOW STOP SAFELY' MESSAGE CAME ON AT LESS THAN 87 MILES ON THE ODOMETER WHILE THE ENGINE WAS RUNNING ON MY DRIVEWAY.

TRANSMISSION SLIPS EXTREMELY BADLY EVEN THOUGH IT DOESNT EVEN HAVE 90K MILES ALMOST MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE TO DRIVE IN CITY AND IS DANGEROUS WHEN NEEDING TO SPEED UP AND SLOW DOWN. TRANSMISSION SLIPS MORE WHEN SPEEDING UP FROM SLOW SPEEDS AND WILL REACH HIGH RPMS OF 4700 EVEN WHEN NOT TOUCHING THE GAS BUT I HAVE HAD IT SLIP ON THE HIGHWAY OUT OF NOWHERE AND IT PEAKED AT 7300 RPM WHEN NOT TOUCHING THE GAS WHICH IS PAST THE REDLINE ON THE RPMS.

SHORTLY AFTER, IN A DRIVE THROUGH WHEN CREEPING FROM FULL STOP TO PULL UP SLIGHTLY, THE PRESSURE WAS DIFFICULT TO APPLY TO THE BRAKE AND AFTER FORCIBLY APPLYING PRESSURE THE VEHICLE CAME TO A VERY DELAYED STOP, VERY NEARLY CAUSING A COLLISION WITH VEHICLE AHEAD IN LINE.      I HAVE TAKEN THE VEHICLE TO THE CHEVY DEALERSHIP, WHERE I WAS ADVISED THE ISSUE QUALIFIED FOR EXTENDED SPECIAL WARRANTY PER THE MANUFACTURER, HOWEVER, I NEVER RECEIVED ANY NOTIFICATION OF THE POTENTIAL KNOWN ISSUE AND FIRMLY BELIEVE GIVEN THE ISSUE BEING A SIGNIFICANT DETRIMENT TO SAFETY - I'D EXPECT A MORE PROACTIVE SAFETY RECALL AS OPPOSED THE THE PASSIVE BREAK-FIX APPROACH."
THE AUTO STEER IN MY TESLA MODEL 3 FAILED TODAY WHEN THE CAR WAS TURNING ON A CURVY DOWNHILL ROAD. I BELIEVE IT'S BECAUSE THE LANE MARKINGS ON THE RIGHT SIDE ENDED JUST BEFORE THE CURBING STARTED. THE CAR SUDDENLY TURNED RIGHT AND HIT THE CURB BRUSHING THE RIGHT FRONT WHEEL. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A FATAL ACCIDENT IF I HADN'T TAKEN OVER. AUTO STEER TECHNOLOGY IS NOT YET READY FOR USE ON ALL THE ROADS AND IT SHOULD NOT BE INCLUDED BY DEFAULT IN ALL THE TESLA MODELS. MY CAR DID NOT BRAKE BECAUSE THE CRUISE CONTROL WAS STILL ON. I AM STILL IN SHOCK AND AFRAID TO USE THE AUTO STEER AGAIN.

LESS THAN 6 MONTHS LATER THE OTHER TAIL LIGHT WENT OUT AND DEALER TOLD US 'LIGHTS GO OUT'.  WE PAID FULL PRICE $680 TO HAVE IT REPLACED.  NOW OUR LEFT TAIL LIGHT IS OUT AGAIN AND IT'LL BE ANOTHER $680 OR MORE TO BE REPLACED.  THIS IS RIDICULOUS.  THEY ARE LED TAIL LIGHTS.  THESE SHE LAST A VERY LONG TIME.  THOUSANDS OF OTHERS ARE HAVING THIS PROBLEM.  CAR GURUS HAS A BLOG SOLELY ABOUT THIS.  THE ODD THING IS THEY ARE MOSTLY 2015 YUKON'S.  A RECALL NEEDS TO BE DONE ON THIS PROBLEM AND THE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE DEALING WITH THIS SHOULD BE REIMBURSED FOR REPLACING THESE TAIL LIGHTS OVER AND OVER!

ABOUT A YEAR AGO WHILE DRIVING ALL OF THE DASHBOARD LIGHTS WOULD COME ON SUCH AS CHECK ENGINE LIGHT AND TIRE PRESSURE LIGHTS. THEN THESE LIGHTS WOULD RANDOMLY TURN OFF. THIS WOULD HAPPEN ON AND OFF FOR A FEW MONTHS. I HAD THE CAR DIAGNOSED TWICE AND THEY FOUND NO ISSUES. NOW I HAVE NOT HAD AND ISSUES WITH THE DASH LIGHTS COMING ON FOR ABOUT THE LAST 6 MONTH EXCEPT FOR NOW THE RADIO COMPLETELY BLACKS OUT FOR ABOUT 15 SECONDS AND IT KNOCKS OUT MY DASH BOARD SPEEDOMETERS THEY ALL COMPLETELY DROP DOWN TO ZERO AND THIS HAPPENS WHILE DRIVING EVEN ON THE HIGHWAY. THIS HAPPENS ONCE OR TWICE A DAY OR SOMETIMES EVERYOTHER DAY. I CANNOT SEE WHAT SPEED I AM GOING AND THE PINS JUST STUTTER.
WHILE DRIVING THE STEERING LIGHT COMES ON AND MAKES THE STEERING VERY HARD TO HANDLE. VERY SCARY ORDEAL. NOT BEING ABLE TO PULL IN SOMEWHERE TO GET OUT OF THE TRAFFIC HOPING NO ONE HITS US FROM BEHIND.

"THE LOW BEAM HEADLIGHTS KEEP GOING OUT. THE BULBS ARE NOT BURNING OUT. IT'S SOMETHING IN THE ELECRICAL THAT'S CAUSING THIS. IT'S VERY DANGEROUS TO DRIVE AT NIGHT BECAUSE BOTH HEADLIGHTS HAVE GONE OFF ALL OF A SUDDEN WHILE DRIVING DOWN THE ROAD. I BELIEVE THIS IS A HUGE SAFETY CONCERN & CHEVY NEEDS TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S GOING ON & HAVE A FIX FOR IT. AFTER READING ON A BUNCH OF FORUMS, THIS IS A HUGE PROBLEM WITH THESE VEHICLES. AFTER GETTING THE BULBS TO WORK, THEY ONLY WORK FOR ABOUT 2 WEEKS THEN GO OUT AGAIN. THIS QUESTIONNAIRE WANTS ME TO PUT IN A DATE THAT THIS HAPPENED BUT IT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME FOR THE LAST 4 YEARS, SO I'LL JUST PUT IN THE MOST RECENT DATE.  "
THE HEADLIGHTS ARE GETTING DIMMER OVER TIME TO THE POINT YOU ARE UNABLE TO SEE AT NIGHT TO SAFELY OPERATE THE VEHICLE. THE REFLECTIVE MATERIAL INSIDE THE HEADLIGHT ASSEMBLY APPEARS TO BE DETERIORATING AND REPLACING THE BULB DOES NOT HELP.

SECOND TIME, DEALER POINTED TO A TSP THAT INDICATED THE SYSTEM WAS BUSY WHEN FIRST STARTING THE VEHICLE AND TO ALLOW FOR EXTRA TIME TO PLACE VEHICLE IN REVERSE.  ISSUE IS NOT RELATED TO PLACING THE CAR IN GEAR, IT ONLY SHOWS THE ISSUE.  ISSUE APPEARS TO BE A SOFTWARE ISSUE IN WHICH THE SYSTEM DOESN'T GET BOOTED UP IN A TIMELY MANNER.

HOW, IF I AM HAVING THE EXACT SAME PROBLEM, IS IT NOT CONSIDERED A 'SAFETY ISSUE' FOR ME? BUT THEY WERE MORE THAN HAPPY TO SCHEDULE ME AN APPOINTMENT TO FIX THE 'KNOWN ISSUE', AT MY EXPENSE OF COURSE. MY VEHICLE ONLY HAS 61,000 MILES, SO THIS IS NOT A NORMAL 'WEAR AND TEAR' ISSUE. ESPECIALLY WHEN I FIND AN ARTICLE BY RUETERS IN WHICH THE VICE PRESIDENT OF GM'S GLOBAL VEHICLE SAFETY SAYS 'WITH THESE SAFETY RECALLS AND LIFETIME WARRANTIES, WE ARE GOING AFTER EVERY CAR THAT MIGHT HAVE THIS PROBLEM, AND WE ARE GOING TO MAKE IT RIGHT,"" SAID JEFF BOYER, VICE PRESIDENT OF GM GLOBAL VEHICLE SAFETY. ""WE HAVE RECALLED SOME OF THESE VEHICLES BEFORE FOR THE SAME ISSUE AND OFFERED EXTENDED WARRANTIES ON OTHERS, BUT WE DID NOT DO ENOUGH.""

I HAVE A TOYOTA COROLLA 2009S IT WAS PART OF THE ORIGINAL TAKATA AIRBAG RECALL THAT ORIGINAL REMEDY WAS COMPLETED IN 2017. SINCE THAT DAY I HAVE TAKEN THE VEHICLE BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP MULTIPLE TIMES AND CONCERNS WITH A FOUL ODOR COMING FROM THE GLOVE COMPARTMENT. I HAVE BEEN CONTACTED BY THE DEALERSHIP VIA EMAIL SAYING THAT I NEED TO BRING IT BACK IN THE AIRBAGS ARE BEING RECALLED THAT WERE USED TO REPLACE THE ORIGINAL RECALL. ONCE I GET TO THE DEALERSHIP THEY SAY MY VIN NUMBER HAS NOT HIT IN HSTA'S WEBSITE SO I'LL JUST HAVE TO WAIT WHICH COULD BE UP TO A YEAR. THEY HAVE INDICATED MULTIPLE TIMES THAT MY VEHICLE IS GOING TO BE RECALLED IT'S JUST A MATTER OF TIME IN THE MEANTIME I'M LEFT TO DRIVE A CAR THAT IS A PUBLIC SAFETY FOR MYSELF AND OTHERS KNOWING THAT THE AIR BAG TO DEPLOY AT ANYTIME. HE INFORMED ME THE VEHICLES IN FLORIDA RECALLS WILL BE REPAIRED FIRST DUE TO THE HEAT AND THEN THEY'LL MOVE THEIR WAY UP TO ZOMBIE IN THE MEANTIME I AM WITHOUT A VEHICLE AND IT'S TOO DANGEROUS FOR MYSELF AND OTHERS TO DRIVE THEY FAILED TO WORK WITH ME.
